<td>Sreya was having some issues with functions from DeconvoBuddies, namley plot_marker_express. I am going to check that on my end as it seems like her computer wasn’t finding the support functions for the main function. She was also having trouble matching the gene names between the sce and bulk rse objects, the ensembl names seemd to have differnt versions, I advided she maybe switch to using the gene symbols to keep things simple.</td>

Created psuedobulk data for three different clustering methods, and went over the basic process of making heatmaps. Bukola will work on the aestetics of the heatmaps, and cerate one for all thee clustering methods.</td>

<td>I have questions on GitHub and submitting SGE jobs.</td>
<td>Uma was having file permission issues, the group permissions for several files in a shared project were set to read only. This was causing issues with the team using scripts but also in making git commits as some of the idex files in .git were read-only. We updated her bashrc files to contain “umask u=rwx,g=rwx,o= ## equivalent to umask 007” to prevent this in the future and ran the premissoin update script.</td>

<td>Deconvolution study with rnaseq bulk data</td>
<td>Sreya wants to test if a gene of intrest to her group is associaited with a ceratain cell type. They are working with bulk mouse data. I suggested that deconvolution may not be able to answer theire innital question but can provide depth to their bulk analysis. I suggested that they find a mouse single cell dataset that is relevant to their current data set, then first observe their gene of interest their, see if that answers any questions. Then they could use that data to run deconvioltion with bisuqe (I suggested a follow up meeting if she needs guidance with this)</td>
</tr>

<td>2022-11-30</td>
<td>Understanding PCA for Habenula project</td>
<td>We discussed how PCA reduces the dimesions of our data and helps show the variance between samples. I helped Bukola strategize how to make PCA plots for the habenula data. Start plotting the first 5 PCs pairwise, color by Dx. Then explore key QC or demographic variables, see if we can indentify any patterns. I was unsure if she should repeat this for exon, jx, tx, as we didnt for MDDseq. But figured gene was a good place to start and if the other features should be explored too, the code should be easily adapatabe.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>2022-11-30</td>
<td>Review deconvolition script for qSVA</td>

<td>help submitting jobs with R parallelization in jhpce. For instance, I would like to use scater::runPCA with the BPPARAM=BiocParallel::MulticoreParam(8)) parameter</td>
<td>Tricia is trying to run glmPCA on the very large MDD snRNA-seq dataset. She has a run submitted without parallelization that has been runing for 3 days. To try and speed things up she has been trying to use BioCparrallel, via MulticoreParam. But the scheduler keeps killing her job. We checked that -pe local X and MulticoreParam(X) match , so it wasn’t that. I recomended she try to run a subset of the data to get a sense of how glmPCA uses memory. But couldn’t come up with a fix to make the parallelization work. As its PCA it also can’t be run as subsets, so there aren’t other workarounds :( I think BioCparallel + sge scheduling would be a good topic for Rstats club as this seems to be a common headache</td>

<td>I have this single nucleus RNA sequencing experiment with the mouse LS that Matt analyzed and we have a final single cell experiment, but I don’t know how to do anything with this data set and want to learn how to plot heatmaps and possibly other things for this data set. Can we maybe schedule an hour to start this learning process and then I can schedule future time as needed?</td>
<td>Lionel walked me through some plots they need for the LS paper: marker genes heatmap and expression violin plots. I pointed him to some code from DLPFC sn that should be helpful (he needs access to this repo). He also needs to get setup with JHPCE on his new laptop, I pointed him to the team laptop setup docs. He also is new to ggplot, so I pointed him to the visulization chapeter of R for data scientist. This will probaly require some follow up meetings</td>

<td>2022-10-26</td>
<td>Check the DEG heatmaps</td>
<td>Daianna has added a new color scheme to the heatmaps that makes the differnces between positive and negative more clear, how ever I think the darkest red being close to 0 is misleading, so shes going to fix that. I also recomended she simplify the annotaions on the combined heatmap so its easier to find and interpret patterns.</td>

<td>2022-10-17</td>
<td>Review TMM paper</td>
<td>We reviewed the reasons or correcting counts and why thats important for DE analysis. We went over the math behind TMM, and then how thoes ideas are used in edgeR. I pointed Bukola to a stats quest video with a more detatiled explination of how the edgeR correction works.</td>

<td>Sang Ho showed me the csv files that he exported from different moduled on HALO. They seem to have the same rows, so copying the needed column in to a differnt csv is easy in excel (where Sang Ho is working) but I showed him how to check that things are really aligned with some excel functions. We also looked at the data in prism, which I had to quickly learned about. I advised that he should show the data in boxplots not as a barplot to better display that data, and went over the checks for running an anova.</td>

<td>2022-10-11</td>
<td>GO and KEGG boxplots with the modifications you suggested</td>
<td>Daianna showed me her dot plots with the correct 0.05 q val filter, they looked good, ready for discussion. One tweak , is hshe had a combined up + down expresion col for some plots which was redundant and should be removed. She had also made some heatmaps that didn;t show very much difference between case control, htey probaly need to be normalized by the genes overall expression, but I need to check prevous work to remeber how to best do that</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>2022-10-10</td>
<td>QC approach for hebenula</td>
<td>We went throught boxplots Bukola had made for the data, I suggested she add geom_jitter and how to make that work with geom_repel to help show more details about the data. We also discussed direct vs. standard evaluation of variable and how that makes writing funcitons with tidyverse tricky, but how she can use aes_() to do stadard eval with ggplot</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2022-10-05</td>
<td>How to check technical effects for RNAseq data</td>
<td>I walked Bukola through our process for buld data QC, which involves making many exploratory plots of QC metrics and know groups (like batch, or case/control) to understand patterns and identify problematics samples. Then later implementing cutoff values either based on stats (like a 3 MAD cut off) or knowlege of ressonable values. Bukola will spend some time plotting QC values, adapting code from smoking mouse, then we will meet again to interpret these plots.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2022-10-05</td>
<td>Reviewing GO results and dotplots</td>
<td>Daianna and I went over the dot plots she made for GO analysis from the multiple DE test she ran. Her plots look good, but we identified that she needed to use the default q cutoff to get useful results. She will rerun the GO analysis and replot the results.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2022-09-30</td>
<td>Working on making a violin plot for just one gene. So by brain region rather than gene type</td>
<td>We adapted my_plotExpression() (a function I wrote) to work for Bukola’s data. This required some debugging as subsetting to just the one gene in question altered how some internal dataframes looked. I also gave Bukola some pointers about saving plots using ggplot.</td>

<td>DE analysis introduction</td>
<td>I went over the DE pipeline we use, noting that the model development is the most demanding and non-static part. We talked specifics for their dataset which has some experimental design to consider as its organids and is diffrent from patient case control. I posinted Geo to scripts where we do QC, expression cutoff, and my run_DE script</td>

<td>Heena saw old commits pop up on slacks git notifications when she pushed commits she had locally on her laptop, but they didn’t reappear in the git history. I think she did everything right and there might be something strange with the behavior of the slack message (as thats the only place things seemd wrong). We did some detective work between the files and the commits, everything seems good. Heena was able to then pull to the cluster with out conflicts</td>

<td>Had to work over slack again as Daianna was having trouble with zoom. Working with the feedback from the previous meetings, the experimetn has been narrowed down to 5 DE runs, and then comparing some pairs of the outputs. We were unsure if we should include mitoRate as a variable in the adult model as it correlates highly with totalAssignedGene, but decided to include it for now to match the model used in the pup DEA. I also sent her some code I have used to make scatter plots of t-stats to help compare DE results.</td>

<td>We checked Sreya’s code against the OSCA DE example run. She was worried that there weren’t may significant genes, but her results seemed to be in the same range (10s of genes) as the example. We discussed how maybe there were QC or demographic variables that could have been added to the model, but the data she has doesn’t have much to work with. We will revisit when I have maybe done more work with sn DE analysis.</td>
