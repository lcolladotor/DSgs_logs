BSP2 is RiboZeroGold for DLPFC and RiboZeroHMR for HIPPO (with 43 RiboZeroGold samples that were dropped from the DE analysis), aligned vs hg38, against Gencode v25 (from July 2016), aligned with HISAT2. I also explained the naming structure of a Supplementary Table for BSP1's paper where `adj`, `qSVA`, and `PCA` are labels specifying whether it was a model `adj`usting for covariates, whether it adjusts for qSVs using `qSVA` (the better model to use), or adjusting for gene-level expression PCs (`PCA`). These names are related to the [`qSVA` 2017 paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1617384114) Figure 2. I also explained how in the BSP2 paper we did re-align the BSP1 data against hg38, though there is no Supplementary Table showing which of the 243 DLPFC DEGs replicated in BSP1 (though the data does exist since it was used to make Figure S28 and S29). We would need another DSgs or two to actually locate the data and construct an CSV file or table that others can use if they are interested in replication of BSP2 results using BSP1 and/or CommonMind Consortium (CMC) Phase 1 data (that was aligned vs hg19 with TopHat2). I also used [this slide](https://speakerdeck.com/lcolladotor/libd-ds-tldr?slide=56) to explain all the pieces that go into a DEG model and why the visualizations provided by the LIBD Data Portal (boxplots for SCZD vs NTC) are just a visual guide using normalized gene expression data and not the full answer (as the LIBD Data Portal doesn't use the full details we include in a DEG model).","I explained in detail the metrics reported by cellranger arc and helped you download a multiome public sample to run the pipeline.","We disscussed specific details on how to ask for help. For example, it's ok to ask those around you in person but you should also ask on the `#libd_helpdesk` channel (and update the channel if someone else gave you an answer). That is, don't assume that only those around you (in person) know the answer. We went over details on how to preview GitHub messages (to verify that they are correctly formatted), why GitHub issues are useful to the authors, what information is needed for others to help you answer a question (R session info, `reprex::reprex()` output, link to code on a public GitHub repo; private is ok when asking internally for help). We also discussed the overall idea of why learning how to make an R package will be useful to then improve one's tooltik for debugging R packages made by others.","I explained the previous steps to perform clustering with GEX and ATAC 10x multiome data using Seurat and Signac.","We went over how to update a GitHub remote following [information from the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories), finishing stylistic design touches on an `iSEE` app, and setting up a new repository for the next project.","We discussed details of the use cases I have in mind for how to search and visualize the JHPCE disk usage data over time and across different JHPCE paths. This information could be useful in forecasting data growth for individual PIs or projects, identifying who has exceeded their storage allocation, identifying static projects that could potentially can be moved off JHPCE / deleted / or moved to non-production disk space.","We discussed the general overview of snRNA-seq data analysis steps and how the code at [`Habenula_Pilot`](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/Habenula_Pilot) could be a good starting place. I also recommended signing up for a Data Science guidance session with Louise as she is quite familiar with the code in that repository prior to diving into it.","I explained details about how data is organized at JHPCE, data sharing limitations, and several suggestions we have been working on that could be useful to implement at a larger scale across LIBD teams.","I pointed to suspicious areas of code where dataset-specific regexs were originally used, though the regexs looked good for his data as well. We decided to interactively walk line by line at a later date","Discussed collaborations, personalities, and other details of the work environment with some of our collaborators with whom this person was going to interview for a job with.","I suggested building a list() where each element was a 3-piece plot (combined with a function like cowplot::plot_grid), then using print(plot_list)","See https://jhu-genomics.slack.com/archives/C018ZDB8QLU/p1710454284251579 for the full code details. We might add this to solution to https://github.com/LieberInstitute/jaffelab/blob/devel/R/merge_rse_metrics.R, although it's only an approximation as you need to go back to the raw ERCC output files (typically generated with `kallisto`) to actually compute the ERCCsumLogErr accurately across different sequencing lanes for a given sample.","We have RSE objects from the LIBD Data Portal (or those that helped build that portal) as well as RSE objects made prior to the LIBD Data Portal. They have some differences, mostly on the `colData()` slot. Note how https://github.com/LieberInstitute/jaffelab/blob/21e65745a5b0852fc13ebdb5e5d23c6f1f66010b/R/merge_rse_metrics.R#L83-L97 and related code merges `colData()` information for samples that were sequenced in more than one lane and whose FASTQ files were not merged prior to aligning with `SPEAQeasy`.","I walked throught the run_DE function I wrote for MDDseq (a wrapper for the limma-voom) pipline. I pointed out what parts of the MDDseq code he could adapt and simplify for his use case (its less complicated than the many DE runs we completed for MDDseq)","I suggested using conda after pip failed (missing system dependencies). Ultimately, my troubleshooting was enough to just build a module for everyone","I explained details about the spatialDLPFC and deconvolution-benchmark papers. I also went over how we addressed feedback from the editors for the spatialDLPFC paper.","Fernando was having some conectivity issues with JHPCE, so we didn't get a full bug fix in I suggested some de-buggin strategies  [Update 3/15] We met again breifly to confirm the functions were working as intended. Initial issue was caused by un-intentinally overwriting the function","We discussed how to address feedback from a recent grant application, how our teams can get to know each other better, cleared up misunderstandings related to my team's role as well as the DSgs system, and decided next steps to respond to the grant reviewers.","I described how a markdown of notes could be added using the Samui python API, though this is not how I had done it in a previous project ( I was unable to trace the original method I used)","We discussed more details about `iSEE` and shinyapps.io deployment details, such as memory settings and other configuration needed to actually customize and share an `iSEE` app. We also asked our collaborator for the list of genes they want to have plotted outside of `iSEE`.","I helped him implement an algorithm taking the minimum pixel intensity in case of overlapping images to display an H&E image in Samui","I diagnosed several potential issues, ultimately missing one detail that was the culprit: permissions were too open on some .ssh files on her laptop","I sent a long and detailed email explaining different components of the LIBD BrainSEQ projects, background information on several covariates we typically have used in DEG models such as RIN and age at time of death, as well as other ones we have not used such as postmortem interval (PMI). I also explained the DSgs system and how it could be used by our JHU collaborators.","We went over internal code from the limma package using https://code.bioconductor.org/, particularly for the `voom()` function. Doing so, we discussed that's actually returned in the `voom()$E` slot. We also went over how to model a ratio using a linear regression model.","We went topics such as live in Baltimore, research at JHU, overview of the different JHU campi, how to compare PhD programs across universities, and other questions this future PhD student had.","Discussed feedback from collaborators and detailed next steps to wrap up this project.","Went over recent updated plots and results, as well as slides for a presentation with our collaborators for 2024-02-21.","We discussed the updates implemented in qsvaR to handle input with ENSEMBL transcript IDs instead of GENCODE ones, updates to automatically detect if the input is at the gene level instead of the transcript level, how to check for correlation between qSVs and covariates, among other related issues.","I described my typical strategy of using left_join by sample ID, as well as ensuring rownames don't get lost from conversion to a tibble (thus dropping colnames from the SummarizedExperiment unintentionally)","I noted that the r_nac module was built similarly to conda_R, where the user doesn't have to do anything special to install more packages. We ultimately traced the issue to permissions problems on files created as part of the proper use of the module by other users, likely due to problematic 'umask' settings","Discussed updates to violing plots and how to organize result files prior to sharing them with our collaborators.","I showed him to the 2 approaches available in Seurat to perform DGE, including the FindMarkers() function to find the genes that are different between control and treatments. I also show him code to perform quality controls in the main covariates related with these data-type. I shared with him consulted resources and links with public-code for his reference.","I ultimately recommended 'git reset --soft' to the commit ID before the recent mistaken addition of the large files","I advised using the SSH address (not HTTPS) for the 'git remote', ensuring the 'git config' email matches the primary GitHub email, and using the up-to-date SSH key (not RSA, which is no longer supported/ recommended)","We explored options: BFG cleaner, git rebase and git reset --soft and discussed which was best for her situation","I described the use of 'srun' (including with X11) vs. 'sbatch', and generally recommended 'sbatch' where possible to document how analyses were run/ ensure reproducibility","Caught up and talked about career development next steps.","I mostly focused on my setup using VS code with its remote SSH extension, and custom keyboard shortcuts for running python code interactively","I mostly confirmed the general process he had started for a particular module made from software packages as a precompiled binary","Went over the details of how to compute a permutation analysis with R.","Sreya wants to compare the correlation of 5 transcipts with 2k degradation transcripts. She had the data in the right format but needed help appllying the cor function to the table using group_by. Corrrplot was not the correct function for what she wanted to achive here.","Clarified updated automatic checks and information for users who attempt to use qsvaR with gene-level data instead of transcript-level data.","I described how code might change when using IF images rather than H&E, for which the code was originally developed","Michael and Peter are working on a BPD vs. MDD DE analysis. They were getting more DEGs than were reported in an early version of the MDDseq project. I could not find the code for the data they were refrencing, with out the code it will be impossible to diagnosis what is differnt in the two analysis. I recomended they use the more up to date data from MDDseq, and pointed them to the correct data & scripts.","Tricia and Fernando are re-running serval analysis they previously had working on the sge cluster, with the update to slurm they are now having issues. They are also having differnt errors in the same scrips + data. This could be a multi-facet issue, but firstly sounds like a R package version issue. I advisded the first step should be to have the same set-up, work in the same version of R and the same version (most updated) packages. See what errors persist and go from there. I also recomended Frenando start using git repos and version control with his team to help keep projects organized and consistent.","We checked udpates to the `getDegTx()` and `DEqual()` functions, as well as discussed the response to a bug report from last year.","I described how to adapt a script I wrote for NAc to her dataset, where the goal was simply to display a stitched-together image in Samui","I traced the issue to the use of 8-bit integers, where an overflow occured during normal addition of pixel values (the solution was to use floats while computing the mean, and then convert back to uint8)","I described how I typically use dplyr::left_join, as well as how to add back missing rownames to the colData (or colnames of the SummarizedExperiment)","I described the conflict between SGE and SLURM R packages, as well as identified lock files preventing re-installation of problematic packages","We traced the offending line of R code in the qsvar package and I described how unit testing could identify problematic function arguments and give more informative error messages","I noted that the function could be applied before the data was converted to long format, where it was impractically large to work with","We identified issues causing incorrect coloring in the Samui outputs","I described how to adapt a script I wrote for NAc to his dataset, where the goal was simply to display a stitched-together image in Samui","I explained the different modules such as `module load conda_R/4.3.x` versus `conda_R/4.3`, how each is tied to a different version of Bioconductor. I also linked to https://youtu.be/D6t2GR7xaTE and https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DD9MUI2e3jp5S8C3PWRulZ4jwbXo94D3UTCQNJl_-Qo/edit?usp=sharing from the LIBD rstats club.","Cynthia and Hedia are starting the annotation/cluster integration of the multiome data. The data is currently clusted indiviudally by sample, sn, ATAC only, and combined sn+ATAC. findMarker has be used to calc marker stats for each cluster in each sample (there is a ton of data to digest). I am unfamilar with the sample independendt cluster, consered marker gene integration from seurat. But I gave advice to check the current clusters for hihg expression of any of the known marker genes to see if we're picking up the expected biological signal, and do some prelimary annotations as a sanity check. Also to keep following the workflow and see if the conserved marker genes match with any of the know markers. Also to start recoring annotations for the clusters in a csv file for easy editing by hand as well as easy reading in to R","Provided feedback on CV writing for data science job applications.","I advised Hedia on how to adress some issues with the qSVA overview plot, both minor issues like aliginig and resising objects with biorender tools, and major rearngment of the table and DE application part.","I described the workflow for stitching Visium capture areas with Samui, and various Samui API functions like 'add_chunked_feature' that are helpful","We discussed the [GLM-PCA paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1861-6) and decided to use GLM-PCA instead of logcounts by `quickCluster()` + `calculateSumFactors()` as described at [the CDSB 2021 snRNA-seq workshop](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/cdsb2021_scRNAseq/normalizaci%C3%B3n-de-datos.html#normalizaci%C3%B3n-por-decircunvoluci%C3%B3n-deconvolution). We also discussed the development version of `Harmony`, in particular with the `lambda = NULL` setting.","We went over how to build a reprex for a user's bug report, how to simplify the process of debugging, and the actual results from this particular bug report. We also discussed how to relay this information back to the person who initially asked the question.","I provided background information on a job ad from a colleague at Boston's Children Hospital that I had shared. I also provided suggestions for preparing their GitHub account, CV, and other information useful for job interviewers.","Hedia has gotten some feedback on some unexpected behavior from qSVAR package. The qSV values show no significant correlation with other phenotype metrics (they have in the past), while this is not impossible it is strange. There are many factors that could have lead to this issue. Hedia and I talked about some debugging strategies, starting with re-running the workflow on familar data to see if we can re-create the issue or detirmine if it is unique to KJ's dataset.","I provided background information on a job ad from a colleague at FHCRC that I had shared.","I gave feedback on scripts, how to organize them, the order of some analytical steps, which gene annotation files to use, and things like that.

I recommended unloading conda_R and avoiding the loading of conda_R via the .bashrc","I described the general process of setting up SPEAQeasy and gave recommendations for his cluster: using singularity and SLURM-based installation/ set-up","I mostly covered documentation but also the appropriate options for his particular data","I investigated a \"failure to submit process to scheduler\" error using 'sacct' and similar commands, ultimately discovering the issue was related to SLURM configuration. There was an email chain with bithelp to follow up","We went over the changes needed to take the current qsvaR paper draft by Josh Stolz to a production-level result (aka for pre-printing / publishing it).","Adapted mode code for tensorQTL prep, had to add genomics ranges to the sce object, and deal with bugs around rse_to_bed function","I followed up with bitsupport, as the issue seemed to involve some failed DNS query internal to SLURM, rather than SPEAQeasy","We walked through old code which aimed to quantify the similarity between significant DE results, interpreting formulas from the code and constructing more intuitive formulas","Ibidem to 2023-09-29 session.","Worked through addapting code for tensorQTL prep for the MDD single cell data - had to deal with bugs relating to cell type names","I gave general advice on re-writing code-- keeping separate scripts, chunking code into segments and testing equality of outputs between old and new code after each chunk, and other strategies","We continued working with the OSCA-based CDSB 2021 intro to snRNA-seq workshop to further understand snRNA-seq data analysis steps, packages, and how they all relate to each other. The person who requested this DSgs was working on the workshop contents and had questions that we reviewed weekly (or so). Once they completed this OSCA-based training, we moved to analyzing an actual unpublished snRNA-seq dataset.","We looked at the rank vs. total UMI curves relevant for emptyDrops for the atac-seq samples. Cynthia and I have discussed these samples before. We went over how the emptyDrops function works again and what we can guesss is happenin in the curve (neurons vs. glia vs. empty droplets).  She is concerned beause for the 42-4 sample the wetbench target number of nuc was 7k, emptyDrops retrurns 9k. I thought that that sounded in the right ball park","I described the 'droplevels()' function, designed to remove unused factor levels","We went over the background for this project (lateral septum) and an overview of the DSgs system, GitHub setup, and other onboarding material.","I discussed how we selected training data for the spot-deconvolution image model-- using logistic regression to compute a confidence metric across the original training examples, that we then binned into 4 quartiles to re-select new examples to label in a less biased way","I mentioned slurmjobs::job_loop and also described how to use it in conjunction with getopt in R for looping over several variables","She had an issue installing a particular R package, which we pinpointed to which modules were loaded (including via bashrc). I also described the general problem of SLURM and SGE versions of JHPCE sharing a library path, which could result in subtle problems. I recommended deleting SGE packages (better would've been backing up!) and reinstalling on SLURM","I helped Fernando modify my code for creating input files to work witht the new pseudobulk data. Wegot the gene PCs done, he needs to get the genotype files together for this data before we can move to the next steps. Planning to meet more next week to continue this process.","Resolved some questions related to https://github.com/ComunidadBioInfo/cdsb2021_scRNAseq and made two pull requests to fix typos.","We went over the math derivations for interpreting beta1, beta2, and beta3 on an interaction model where X1 is a continuous variable, X2 is a discrete variable with 2 options and we model `Y ~ X1 * X2`. We also used `ExploreModelMatrix`.","I explained the benefits of centering and scaling and referred to both the short video on this topic https://youtu.be/c8ffeFVUzk8 as well as the material we developed for the CSHL 2023 course https://lcolladotor.github.io/cshl_rstats_genome_scale_2023/expression-heatmaps-with-complexheatmap.html.","Peter and Reza were interested in running deconvolution on the bulk MDDseq with the new large MDD snRNA-seq dataset.

I them to the current deconvolution results and how we applied thoes results in downstream analysis.","I walked Fernando through using registration_pseudobulk() on the large MDD single cell dataset and went over how the function works. We are planning to meet agian to go over running PCA to prep for eQTL analysis.","I noted the 'www' directory (or the directory passed to the 'docs_path' parameter) controls the home page, and we typically use a relative soft link to the main repository README for the bulk of the content.","I described the general workflow, involving ImageJ, Samui, VisiumStitcher, and custom R + python code needed to eventually produce SpatialExperiment objetcs with one donor per sample. I focused on the high level of what the Samui piece looked like/ how much work is involved","Continued reviewing material from https://github.com/ComunidadBioInfo/cdsb2021_scRNAseq","Discussed a few ideas about LIBD and social media","I showed code examples of writing array jobs with SLURM (and how it compares to SGE), then diagnosed an X11 forwarding issue where the '-x11' srun option was insufficient. Adding X11-related configuration in the SSH config fixed the issue (i.e. ForwardX11 and ForwardX11Trusted lines)","I discussed diagnosing marker quality with Maddy + Stephanie Page for the spatial hypocampus project. They are on the right track, and have created violin + hockystick plots for the different iterations of the dataset. I advised they elimate a noisy cluster and re-compute markers.","I described the pieces that go into a bookdown-powered documentation site, showing RMD code examples and the GHA workflow that deploys the site","I noted that Samui supports many types of features, and the spatial coordinates of cells can be supplied instead of spot coordinates to display features related to cells","I described the meaning of cell2location outputs and how to compare outputs between software tools. I also described where plots came from in R","Alan has used MAD cutoffs on total UMIs, genes detected, mito %, and a metric we haven't worked with yet: genes per UMI. He evaluated the data all together (not by sample) and chose #Mads by what seemed reasonable. The values he has used look good, but perhaps a bit strict. We looked at the distributions, which are slightly different between samples, I advised he use scater::isOutlier to see what the cutoffs would be by sample. One step he is lacking is doublet detection, I suggested he apply scDblFinder::computeDoubletDensity. Alan already has clusteres and annoted this data (lots of work) I suggested that a great double check is to calcluate the median value of the QC metrics for each final cluster and see if any are much higher than the others as a good double check that his initial QC process worked well.","Answered questions related to material at https://github.com/ComunidadBioInfo/cdsb2021_scRNAseq","We talked about the first scripts in https://github.com/LieberInstitute/ranger_metrics","He noted that not all measured genes were displayed in the Visium_SPG_AD project. I found in the code why I subsetted and made a GH issue to fix it","I shared my favored set up for getting computational work done: working directly on JHPCE via the SSH extension for VSCode, using system-wide JHPCE modules for consistent software versioning, and X11 for interactive plotting (with a note I tend to just create and view PDFs for complex plots)","My major recommendation was learning version control with git, though I also mentioned learning SGE/SLURM also is a valuable skill for larger-scale coding projects. I helped him create a git repository for his current project (including account set up) and described the basics of git add, commit, and push","I described how the various scripts connect in spatialDLPFC for my work with deconvolution, to help share and re-use them for her project","We talked about material at https://github.com/ComunidadBioInfo/cdsb2021_scRNAseq","I explained the status of the recount-pump transfer, where files were, and noted that chris or JHPCE admins would have to change permissions to allow her access to some files","I noted that modules at SGE vs. SLURM are totally disjoint, and that the HOSTNAME trick originally used in the team recommended bashrc didn't (at the time, though this has recently changed) work anymore, and the SLURMD_NODENAME variable can instead be used to infer where the user is","I gave some pointers about writing tweets. Mostly keep it simple, give people a call to action \"check out this link!\", add something eye catching. Also to spend sometime reading tweets and pay attention to what you like that other people tweet? What caught your interest? We also talked some stradgedy about tweeting around confrences, calling peoples attention to your talk/making it easy for people to find you to get in touch","We talked about how I became an Investigator at LIBD, the overall type of work we do as a team, some of our main collaborations, and overall plans for applying for funding in the future. In particular, I highlighted how I want to train team members on how to write an NIH biosketch, though not all are going to be \"key personnel\". I sent a link to the DSgs, team meeting schedule, rstats club schedule, and our http://lcolladotor.github.io/talk/teamtldr2022/ summary from April 20, 2022.","I did a complete tutorial of using the Samui API to create Samui-importable directories, including how to preprocess image files and how to host results publicly","We talked thorough the thigns to think about for the Mathy's dataset (this dataset has case + control paitents and found DEGs w/in cell types). I advised to start simple with the broad cell tytpes and not consider Dx at first. Check if the DEG they idetified are in our marker set. I think this will need some discussion with the project team if Dx is a concern for spot deconvolution.","https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialDLPFC_SCZ/commit/5e84f5ce32e6723b1a1eea20dc47ee320d55ca10",null,"He noted that just taking the most plentiful cell type in any cluster was leading to too many clusters with excitatory layer-5 cells. I mentioned that the raw outputs of spot deconvolution tools are fairly unreliable, but they still carry useful information when normalized. For his example, I mentioned dividing by the total number of cells for each cell type when making comparisons between cell types","Suggested deleting all old files as the code might be appending data instead of creating new files and also increasing the h_fsize, as the error relates disk space","guided him to the search engine on REDCap","For deconvolution, we talked about finding an appropriate reference dataset and we talked about an expert we can contact to ask which dataset(s) might be the most relevant. For snRNA-seq data analysis, I mentioned OSCA (Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor) and how Louise could help guide this person on our code based off OSCA through a series of DSgs sessions.","removing the top 2500 pixels before splitting the image corrects the offset","I mentioned (information) entropy as a metric that would determine how well a gene is confined to a particular cluster (using average counts of a gene across all spots in each cluster, then normalizing the sum to add to 1), but cautioned that I wasn't familiar with favored metrics within the field","We transferred https://github.com/LieberInstitute/qsvaRPkgDemo to the LieberInstitute account. I asked to include some citations for sources (like the image source) and some other small edits. For GO / KEGG enrichment with clusterProfiler I asked to not filter results (pvalueCutoff / qvalueCutoff parameters), so we can see more results prior to choosing which ones to plot.","We ttok a look at the changes in the clustring in the spatial data before and after cropping out a area of questionalble quality. To me it looks like the QC params are too strict leaving spots floating in space, which I'm guessing is contributing to weird BayesSpace results (but this is a guess). We also talked code organization strtagedy - mostly keep it simple and consistent","I helped Hedia improve the formatting & content for her BioC qSVA workshop, main feedback ins to focus on and highlight the qsvaR steps in the workflow (rather than SummarizedExperiment overvew & DEG analysis)","We discussed the current status of the team, the project, what skills are required, boundaries in terms of time and who would be involved (and who wouldn't). We ended the session with me relaying a list of resources to check and read more carefully. Then in about 2 weeks we'll meet again to determine the next steps.","We made a Google sheet with columns such as `study_type`, `skill_name`, `learning_priority`, etc. I also worked on it after the DSgs session to help complete the current information.

Uploads through Cyberduck can trigger this. The solution is to run https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/organizing-your-work.html#spatialteam-example again on a qrsh session.","Cynthia has run DropletUtils::emptyDrops on the two LIBD + two example samples. We first clarified some terms and outputs she had recorded. For the most part DropletUtils returns similar number of non-empty cells as CellRanger arc, but Cynthia didn't confirm that the two methods flag the same cells. I asked her to creat a confision matrix between the two methods for each sample to check this.  The main concern Cynthia has was the LIBD sample with only  3k cells input, has 9k non-empty droplets returned by emptyDrops. This is quite odd as the CellRanger Arc metrics look quite bad for this sample, but the DropletUtils metrics look fine (there are high UMI values for many droplets). We will want to dig in to this more to understand the differnces between the two methods.","We worked on qsvaR debugging an issue raised by Renee and Louise. We then improved the error messages on qsvaR as noted at https://github.com/LieberInstitute/qsvaR/commit/feb9a9e4f8a499baba76271de37ca39a9969f400.","Using the septum lateral data, I trained Ryan on how to make this type of Globus endpoint, how to set up the right permissions, how to edit and update http://research.libd.org/globus/ (see [this](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/globus/blob/b10e0fb89c40489d23028e8ed3f7812cdea76a6b/index.Rmd#L57) for details), and how to document the Globus information on a manuscript.","Using the lateral septum snRNA-seq data, I trained Heena on how to filter a SingleCellExperiment object to reduce the required memory from 7GB to less than 1GB in order to be able to deploy an iSEE app at shinyapps.io, whose computers have a maximum of 8 GB of RAM.

Then started a pull request using usethis for qSVA, for Hedia to add seed capabilities to several functions. We will need to meet several more times to complete the whole help request","Uma mentioned that she had to login everytime she pushed a commit from the directory in question (but not other repos). I thought we should start by using a github access token to update her login to github from JHPCE. The best way I know how to do this is to use gitcreds::gitcreds_set() in R. At first it gave us an error, which was solved by adding the git modules loaded in the team bashrc to Uma's basrc file as well as her .gitconfig file. After that we were able to save the token to her JHPCe setup and the github push issue seemed to be solved","I described the 'add_coords' function, how features link to existing coordinates, and that coords must have at least one associated feature to display","I referred her to recent versions of my code (spatialDLPFC and SPG_AD projects) and walked through the high-level steps of each","Reviewed input for tensorqtl (it is counts, not logcounts), and revised what how we filter lowly expressed exon-exon junctions using http://research.libd.org/jaffelab/reference/expression_cutoff.html.","Discussed how to best pseudobulk the data prior to doing this type of analysis.

It appeared she didn't have an SSH keypair set up with GitHub, so we set that up to fix the issue","Hedia was concerned about the large number of variables in the reproducibility DE experiment, specifically the PC. I pointed out that the point of the anlaysis was to test the effectiveness of the models (with and without qSVs) so while this might be a valid concern in a sperate DE analysis, we are testing model quality here. I also noticed that the reproducibility anlaysis was not using functions from the qsvaR package, and that as qsvaR is the \"product\" of this whole project its important we use the functions in this anlysis .","I described typical expected alignment rates, the difference between concordant and overall map rate, and details about other SPEAQeasy output metrics","I explained that at the time, I just created the RMD file and added any referenced images to the rstatsclubsource repo, following naming conventions that include the post date and hyphens between words in the blog title.

We fixed Boyi's bashrc to allow group write by deafult, fixing the ,git issue and eliminating the need to re-run the permission update script often","I showed how glob expressions can be used to conveniently match many files across potentially several files, and described gitignore-specific rules, such as certain wildcard expression matching files no matter what directory they are in","Uma was having file permission issues, the group permissions for several files in a shared project were set to read only. This was causing issues with the team using scripts but also in making git commits as some of the idex files in .git were read-only. We updated her bashrc files to contain \"umask u=rwx,g=rwx,o= ## equivalent to umask 007\" to prevent this in the future and ran the premissoin update script.","Bukola hads run muliple clustering methods on the habenula data, I advised she pick the two that were the most simmlar to ERiks previous annotations (we were happy with) via rand index, and start examining marker gene expression.","I went over details like naming the OneDrive folder and correctly using CrossReference to refer to that name in figures and references to those figures","I helped port several plots into Illustrator as a figure, describing our normal process of using PDFs and linked files to maintain resolution.","I showed how to filter for individuals with a certain condition, and subset two data frames with the same criteria.","She was unable to clone private repositories due to a problem with her SSH key with GitHub.

However we ran in to some bugs with running logNormCounts which we think is from an old version of R. I advised that she update R and re-install the packages, hopefull that will fix the issue.","We uncovered the source of some unwanted NA values in some genotyping data and eliminated it by removing some code","I helped Sreya build a single cell experiment object with expression and metadata csvs she had from an publication. Hopefully she can use this to independently explore the gene expression her group is interested in.","We talked about how to compute KL divergence between 2 groups of cell-type proportions on her data using a variation of my code","Hedia wanted some background information about the deconvolution process we applied to the degradation data. I explained the mean ratio marker finding, the resulting stats, and how we ued them to build our set of marker genes. Then the script for how we ran bisque + the output of bisque .","Sreya wants to test if a gene of intrest to her group is associaited with a ceratain cell type. They are working with bulk mouse data. I suggested that deconvolution may not be able to answer theire innital question but can provide depth to their bulk analysis. I suggested that they find a mouse single cell dataset that is relevant to their current data set, then first observe their gene of interest their, see if that answers any questions. Then they could use that data to run deconvioltion with bisuqe (I suggested a follow up meeting if she needs guidance with this)","I described the manual process for resolving a merge conflict with git when git cannot automatically merge two branches","We pinpointed an error message as being due to trying to find the 'colData' of a list containing Summarized Experiments rather than calling 'colData' on the SummarizedExperiment itself","I described how to color ggplot2 plots by a continuous variable, adjust the palette, and other ggplot-related syntax/tricks","We discussed how PCA reduces the dimesions of our data and helps show the variance between samples. I helped Bukola strategize how to make PCA plots for the habenula data. Start plotting the first 5 PCs pairwise, color by Dx. Then explore key QC or demographic variables, see if we can indentify any patterns. I was unsure if she should repeat this for exon, jx, tx, as we didnt for MDDseq. But figured gene was a good place to start and if the other features should be explored too, the code should be easily adapatabe.","I gave Hedia a breif overview of the goals and process of deconvolution, including mean ratio marker finding. I linked my deconvolution slides. We then went over the code for running bisque on the qSVA dataset, including details of the input, refrence, and output data.","I recommended some data-preprocessing steps for later downstream manipulation of the data","I gave general advice for how to preprocess some data, including changing data types, transposing matrices, and dropping columns to format things for a collaborator","I described 'facet_wrap' and showed that for some situations, 'plot_grid' with a single output PDF (with width and height scaled appropriately) does well","We generally discussed linear mixed effects models and some common terms used as fixed effects in genomic data","Tricia is trying to run glmPCA on the very large MDD snRNA-seq dataset.

I pointed him to some code from DLPFC sn that should be helpful (he needs access to this repo). He also needs to get setup with JHPCE on his new laptop, I pointed him to the team laptop setup docs. He also is new to ggplot, so I pointed him to the visulization chapeter of R for data scientist. This will probaly require some follow up meetings","Daianna has added a new color scheme to the heatmaps that makes the differnces between positive and negative more clear, how ever I think the darkest red being close to 0 is misleading, so shes going to fix that. I also recomended she simplify the annotaions on the combined heatmap so its easier to find and interpret patterns.","We reviewed the reasons or correcting counts and why thats important for DE analysis. We went over the math behind TMM, and then how thoes ideas are used in edgeR. I pointed Bukola to a stats quest video with a more detatiled explination of how the edgeR correction works.","Sang Ho showed me the csv files that he exported from different moduled on HALO. They seem to have the same rows, so copying the needed column in to a differnt csv is easy in excel (where Sang Ho is working) but I showed him how to check that things are really aligned with some excel functions. We also looked at the data in prism, which I had to quickly learned about. I advised that he should show the data in boxplots not as a barplot to better display that data, and went over the checks for running an anova.","I mentioned rtracklayer::liftOver and showed a code example of lifting over genomic coordinates for a SummarizedExperiment","Daianna showed me her dot plots with the correct 0.05 q val filter, they looked good, ready for discussion. One tweak , is hshe had a combined up + down expresion col for some plots which was redundant and should be removed. She had also made some heatmaps that didn;t show very much difference between case control, htey probaly need to be normalized by the genes overall expression, but I need to check prevous work to remeber how to best do that","We went throught boxplots Bukola had made for the data, I suggested she add geom_jitter and how to make that work with geom_repel to help show more details about the data. We also discussed direct vs. standard evaluation of variable and how that makes writing funcitons with tidyverse tricky, but how she can use aes_() to do stadard eval with ggplot","I walked Bukola through our process for buld data QC, which involves making many exploratory plots of QC metrics and know groups (like batch, or case/control) to understand patterns and identify problematics samples. Then later implementing cutoff values either based on stats (like a 3 MAD cut off) or knowlege of ressonable values. Bukola will spend some time plotting QC values, adapting code from smoking mouse, then we will meet again to interpret these plots.","Daianna and I went over the dot plots she made for GO analysis from the multiple DE test she ran. Her plots look good, but we identified that she needed to use the default q cutoff to get useful results. She will rerun the GO analysis and replot the results.","We adapted my_plotExpression() (a function I wrote) to work for Bukola's data. This required some debugging as subsetting to just the one gene in question altered how some internal dataframes looked.

After batch correction there is one sample that clusters mostly independently from the other samples. This sample did not stand out in QC (althogh this will be re-examined). There is some evidence that this donor might have been clinacally different from the other donors, and since the batch correction worked well for the other samples, there is the possibility that this is real biologal signal. However since there is only one such sample it would be really hard to confirm this, and the inclusion of this sample would counfound the biologcal question of interest. I advisied to drop this sample post-clustering on the grounds that this donor might be too differnt from the others. **2**. Prelimnary results from DEG by cell type for the three groups find mitocondral genes are the most differntly expressed. They are concerned as MT RNA could be a technical artifact (contamination) this tech isn't the best to explore this. But there is are other findings that cellular metabolism may play a role in this condition. I advisied to keep the DEG results with the MT, add the caveat in the paper that this might not be a perfect experiment for this but it could support real differnces in the cells (plus they already have pretty strict MT QC).

Some studies might require more complicated models than others, as they might be from more than one brain region or present some batch effect. In addition, in newer projects we are considering adjusting for cell type fractions derived from deconvolution. Even if all the covariates were fixed across datasets, in DEGs we have typically adjusted for qSVs which are computed in a dataset-dependent fashion and in essence are PCs derived from degradation-associated genomic regions. Similarly, for eQTLs we adjust for expression PCs. In both we adjust for ancestry PCs. Computing PCs is input-dependent: you won't get the same values or PCs if you change which samples you are using. So, computing DEGs and eQTLs is not as simple as say a map-reduce problem where you compute the same thing for every input sample, then aggregate the per-sample results. We have steps that depend on the whole sample set. Then there's also steps for filtering expression features based on some minimum expression cutoffs. Plus, differences between say polyA and RiboZero data, which don't make sense to process together. For these reasons, I don't think that an on-demand computation pipeline is feasible based on a user selecting a set of input samples. Constructing RNA-seq objects (RangedSummarizedExperiment objects) as well as DNA genotyping VCF files based on a set of input samples is feasible and that's what others are building.

For the most part DropletUtils returns similar number of non-empty cells as CellRanger arc, but Cynthia didn’t confirm that the two methods flag the same cells. I asked her to creat a confision matrix between the two methods for each sample to check this.  The main concern Cynthia has was the LIBD sample with only  3k cells input, has 9k non-empty droplets returned by emptyDrops. This is quite odd as the CellRanger Arc metrics look quite bad for this sample, but the DropletUtils metrics look fine (there are high UMI values for many droplets).

Some studies might require more complicated models than others, as they might be from more than one brain region or present some batch effect. In addition, in newer projects we are considering adjusting for cell type fractions derived from deconvolution. Even if all the covariates were fixed across datasets, in DEGs we have typically adjusted for qSVs which are computed in a dataset-dependent fashion and in essence are PCs derived from degradation-associated genomic regions. Similarly, for eQTLs we adjust for expression PCs. In both we adjust for ancestry PCs. Computing PCs is input-dependent: you won’t get the same values or PCs if you change which samples you are using. So, computing DEGs and eQTLs is not as simple as say a map-reduce problem where you compute the same thing for every input sample, then aggregate the per-sample results. We have steps that depend on the whole sample set. Then there’s also steps for filtering expression features based on some minimum expression cutoffs. Plus, differences between say polyA and RiboZero data, which don’t make sense to process together. For these reasons, I don’t think that an on-demand computation pipeline is feasible based on a user selecting a set of input samples. Constructing RNA-seq objects (RangedSummarizedExperiment objects) as well as DNA genotyping VCF files based on a set of input samples is feasible and that’s what others are building.
