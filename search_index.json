So, the data processing would be “easy” in a sense. Next, you might want to check the bsseq documentation https://bioconductor.org/packages/bsseq/ if you are interested in finding differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and in any case, because BiocMAP provides that type of R object as noted at http://research.libd.org/BiocMAP/outputs.html. https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/wgbsExprs/ and the companion paper is the last WGBS data analysis project I did myself with code at https://github.com/LieberInstitute/brain-epigenomics. Kira Perzel-Mandell, who worked with Shizhong, wrote https://github.com/LieberInstitute/wgbs_meqtl_analysis (link to paper there) and did other projects. If you are plotting methylation levels at some locations, then that’s very direct. If you are trying to find DMRs, it can take a bit of time to get used to the large objects and the related complications (once you filter the data, it’ll be more manageable). If you go into CpH instead of CpG, then memory constraints become harder to deal with. 2022-02-18 Ideas for possible future analyses NA 2022-02-16 JHPCE array jobs and fasthplus Related to JHPCE https://github.com/ntdyjack/fasthplus and http://research.libd.org/sgejobs/ 2022-02-15 snRNA-seq and deconvolution overview Brainstormed several ideas related to deconvolution of bulk data as well as uses of snRNA-seq.

These details can take longer to complete than initially anticipated. 2021-07-30 Git branches We revised how to make a new branch in Git working with https://github.com/lmweber/OSTA-book 2021-07-28 DNA genotyping overview We discussed the current DNA genotype pipeline and potential changes others might want. 2021-07-20 Overview of the RNA-seq universe From SPEAQeasy, to qSVA, deconvolution, TWAS, etc. It might be best to give a talk about all these topics to whoever is interested at LIBD since we know about all these pieces but others might not. 2021-07-13 Setting up a team at LIBD We talked about https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/ among other topics. 2021-07-01 How to set up a GitHub actions-powered website This has changed over time. The most recent setup (as of 2021-08-06) is at https://github.com/lmweber/OSTA-book 2021-06-29 How to choose and add a licence to a GitHub repo We talked about https://choosealicense.com/, https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository, https://creativecommons.org/choose/. 2021-06-29 Designing an MS-level class We discussed the posibility of proposing a class that has a mix of biology lectures and some practical coding sessions. The coding sessions could be based after the CDSB 2021 mini courses series. 2021-06-29 Planning session for getting up to speed with SpatialExperiment, spatialLIBD, here and ggplot2 We talked about the set of videos and resources publicly available to get to learn about R, Bioconductor and these packages. It was a lot of information and I’m sure that we’ll have more sessions later on to clarify questions as they arise. 2021-06-21 Locating public data at JHPCE + bamtofastq workflow We talked about the public data from Synapse and worked on locating some of it at JHPCE. I explained also how we have used bamtofastq when others don’t share their FASTQ files. Basically, we use bamtofastq to reconstruct the original FASTQ files (you might have to append the unmapped FASTQs if they are provided by the original authors) and then run FASTQ-processing tools like our SPEAQeasy pipeline. 2021-06-17 Brainstorming session on collaboration I showed the initial version of the BrainSeq Phase II developmental expression explorer developed by Bill Ulrich and Aaron Goldman. We discussed other possibilities for the collaboration including helping set up SPEAQeasy in their servers. 2021-06-17 How to transfer recount3 data We met to figure out how to transfer the data for this collaboration, which ended up being quite tricky and involved using an SSH tunnel for rsync. Basically, a command like this one: rsync -avzh -e 'ssh -o ProxyJump=user@server_somewhere_for_the_tunnel' *_files_of_interest user@final_server:/final_path/ 2021-06-17 How to get started with R We discussed the different possible goals and ways to get to them and determined a path forward that relies on the rest of the DSgs system as well as existing LIBD rstats club videos to get started. It’ll be supported by a meeting with Leo and others involved in the spatial transcriptomics projects from the R side. 2021-06-02 How to prepare for a LIBD seminar part 4 We discussed the changes that we should make and the ones we shouldn’t based on the feedback received from the practice talk with Keri’s group. The feedback was excellent and very useful, however, we discussed which suggestions were maybe complicating the presentation too much and how to best incorporate them. 2021-05-26 How to prepare for a LIBD seminar part 3 Similar to part 2. The presentation was looking very polished by this meeting! 2021-05-24 Grant application review Helped review the grant application and revise the text. 2021-05-21 PredictDB weights Further updates on asking for help with this complicated project. Suggested reaching out to other LIBD members who have tried running the software before. 2021-05-20 How to prepare for a LIBD seminar part 2 Now that a first major draft of the presentation was complete, we revised it and proposed some changes to it. Some of them involved remaking the figures using base_size = 20 or even 30 with ggplot2. For future work, it might be best to save the images with that font size from the beginning instead of having to update them later. 2021-05-20 Help preparing a figure for a grant application Discussed with Josh what figures we needed to prepare and how to generate them. This also involved base_size = 30 with ggplot2. Otherwise the font was too small to read it on the grant. 2021-05-10 Setting up covr using GitHub actions in an R package We went over the details of the GitHub actions workflow created by biocthis, the parts that you need to run from biocthis::use_bioc_pkg_templates(), and resolving issues prompted by R CMD check + BiocCheck 2021-05-07 How to get started with computational biology I gave an overview of the resources and materials we have created as well as the LIBD bootcamps that we have publicly available to help others get started with computational biology. This is likely the first of several meetings. 2021-05-07 How to insert a figure using the Oxford Bioinfomratics Overleaf LaTeX template We spent a significant amount troubleshooting the problem here (nearly two hours?). In the end, using the insert image “here” LaTeX syntax resolved the problem. 2021-05-06 How to prepare for a LIBD seminar Initial planning session for the LIBD seminar. We talked about the different slides we planned to show and the flow of the presentation. We also scheduled 3 practice talks with different groups of people. 2021-05-06 PredictDB weights General advice on how to ask for help from open source projects 2021-05-03 TWAS prep Overview of the TWAS pipeline 2021-04-08 General guidance on how to learn how to do differential expression analyses Created a learning plan involving several team members that is now documented at a channel in JHU Genomics Slack. That way everyone can keep track of what others are teaching the person who asked the question, and we can have a common communication channel among everyone involved. Sessions include learning how to interact with JHPCE through RStudio, how to run SPEAQeasy, key R/Bioconductor packages (limma, SummarizedExperiment), and explore possible visualizations of interest. 2021-03-29 spatialLIBD support Discussion about features that spatialLIBD could support to make it easier to use for newer data. 2021-03-25 Creating a documentation website using bookdown Help with understanding bookdown and ideas on how to organize a documentation website (chapters and information to consider). 2021-03-25 Clarification of LIBD support Discussed the research project proposal and how we can help. 2021-03-25 General advice General advice. Received feedback regarding file backups. 2021-03-24 Download SRA data and run SPEAQeasy I identified that https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154829 contains both miRNA and RNA-seq data. Using data from the SRA Run selector at https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP273137&amp;o=acc_s%3Aa I was able to filter the data to the RNA-seq samples and subset the input samples.manifest file for SPEAQeasy. 2021-03-24 Explain the feasibility of an on-demand end user interface for DEG and eQTLs To identify DEGs or eQTLs, the user has to choose what covariates to adjust for. Some studies might require more complicated models than others, as they might be from more than one brain region or present some batch effect. In addition, in newer projects we are considering adjusting for cell type fractions derived from deconvolution. Even if all the covariates were fixed across datasets, in DEGs we have typically adjusted for qSVs which are computed in a dataset-dependent fashion and in essence are PCs derived from degradation-associated genomic regions. Similarly, for eQTLs we adjust for expression PCs. In both we adjust for ancestry PCs. Computing PCs is input-dependent: you won’t get the same values or PCs if you change which samples you are using. So, computing DEGs and eQTLs is not as simple as say a map-reduce problem where you compute the same thing for every input sample, then aggregate the per-sample results. We have steps that depend on the whole sample set. Then there’s also steps for filtering expression features based on some minimum expression cutoffs. Plus, differences between say polyA and RiboZero data, which don’t make sense to process together. For these reasons, I don’t think that an on-demand computation pipeline is feasible based on a user selecting a set of input samples. Constructing RNA-seq objects (RangedSummarizedExperiment objects) as well as DNA genotyping VCF files based on a set of input samples is feasible and that’s what others are building. After that, I think that it’s best to adapt code we have (or even use newer tools) after carefully exploring the data. 2021-03-11 BSP2 eQTLs with a subset of SNPs Adapted code and shared it at https://github.com/LieberInstitute/brainseq_phase2/tree/master/eQTL_full/subset_hancock 2021-03-10 How to write a small methods paper Created GitHub issues at https://github.com/LieberInstitute/VisiumImgProcessing/issues 2021-02-05 BSP2 LIBD eQTLs request NA 2021-01-29 Help determining what data is available and what can be used for an analysis Use of galaxybrain for identifying samples with DNAm, DNA genotype and RNA-seq data 2021-01-26 Guidance on how to download data from a study in GEO NA 2021-01-14 biocthis macOS GHA bug BioC Support website answer 2021-01-11 Questions related to accessing results from the DG paper by Andrew Jaffe NA 2020-11-25 Accesing CMC RNA-seq data Started PsychENCODE access request process 2020-11-11 GitHub actions workflow issue with macOS on R-devel GitHub issue at biocthis 2020-11-11 Differences between recount2’s “bp_length” and SPEAQeasy’s “Length” Check Slack helpdesk channel 2020-11-03 Issue with knitcitations GitHub issue at biocthis 2020-11-03 Fixed a bug on biocthis for release branches GitHub issue at biocthis 2020-11-03 Fixed two bugs on recount3 related to locate_url() for the BigWig files.

Another user and I weren’t able to replicate the issue. We later discovered that there were lines in her .bashrc that might’ve interfered with the module to produce the issue. 2022-02-04 Using tensorqtl with a GPU I described how to qrsh/sub jobs with the GPU node, including how to automatically set up ‘CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES’ to avoid contention for resources, and how to use the tensorqtl module to ensure GPUs were used when importing pytorch 2022-02-04 X11 and SSH issues After ensuring our apparent Rstudio set-ups on our windows machines matched, she still wasn’t able to forward X11 while using Rstudio. Regarding a different issue, we discovered that a particular machine required additional lines in the ‘~/.ssh/config’ to properly enable RSA keys. 2022-01-21 accessing the ‘gpu’ node at JHPCE correctly I described how it’s accessed as a queue, but some manual work is left to the user (checking which GPUs are open and setting ‘CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES’) 2021-12-15 creating a ‘samples.manifest’ and choosing trimming settings I described how I normally deduce sample IDs from FASTQ filenames when creating a ‘samples.manifest’ file for SPEAQeasy, described the difference between ‘–trim_mode’ settings that SPEAQeasy supports, and showed how to check what samples were trimmed. 2021-11-17 using ‘list.files’ in R I described using regular expressions in R to match files in a directory. We encountered a weird case where ‘list.files’ seemed to return different numbers of matched files when run repeatedly. After ensuring we were in the right directory, the issue went away, but it was unclear what caused the original problem. 2021-10-06 help with git I explained how I get out of the situation where files that are too big get accidentally committed (using ‘git log’, ‘git reset –soft’, and other details) 2021-10-04 debugging SPEAQeasy errors We worked through an error message from the ‘VariantsMerge’ process, uncovering (arguably) a bug in SPEAQeasy, and I advised how to temporarily circumvent the problem. I also suggested a command for renaming a set of files that initially broke SPEAQeasy’s assumptions. 2021-09-22 help with ‘umask’ and git I talked about how Linux does not allow creation of files w/ execution permissions set, regardless of ‘umask’ settings such as in the ‘.bashrc’. I also explained how I use branching with git and other tips for managing a repo that others also develop on. 2021-09-10 merging FASTQ files automatically via SPEAQeasy We downloaded a metadata table from SRA and parsed it through R to programatically create a “samples.manifest” file for use in SPEAQeasy, that merged samples that were each split into multiple FASTQ files. 2021-09-03 identifying SPEAQeasy error SPEAQeasy would appear to run into “file not found” errors for just a handful of random samples in a large dataset. I eventually traced the error to a disk mounting issue on a particular compute node, which was resolved through bitsupport. 2021-08-26 resuming SPEAQeasy after an issue in the counts step I mentioned that she encountered a bug that was fixed in a more recent version of SPEAQeasy, but suggested she manually add a line of code temporarily so that she could resume the run before updating 2021-08-25 downloading FASTQ files from SRA I referred her to a script I had written in the past that contains the required commands and configuration (with comments) for using the SRA toolkit 2021-08-06 Forming a data frame from data in multiple files I showed a fairly standard method for concatenating tabular data from multiple files into a single matrix, and saving the resulting R object 2021-07-14 getting SPEAQeasy running In a series of email exchanges we diagnosed subtle errors resulting from bad FASTQ files and unintended options in the main script. Her feedback helped me improve some existing documentation. 2021-07-14 debugging SPEAQeasy errors I described correct use of the “–input” argument, and we also found that many of the input FASTQs were empty, leading to a somewhat vague error message. 2021-07-13 formatting a LaTeX document and bookdown website I attempted some formatting tricks to eliminate unwanted whitespace but was ultimately unsuccessful. We suspected the LaTeX template required the whitespace to exist. We also tried to fix a bug with the header of a bookdown RMD not rendering as expected. It seemed that re-writing the header (without making any visible changes) fixed the issue, though we weren’t sure of the source of the initial problem. 2021-07-02 Help indexing a possibly corrupt VCF file We confirmed that an existing VCF was corrupt and found that tabix expected bgzip-compressed VCF input rather than compressed BCF input. 2021-06-30 Specifying output logs on SGE I briefly mentioned the “#$ -o” and “#$ -e” arguments, and how several logs will generate in your home directory without those arguments and without “#$ -cwd”, when “qsub”ing a job at JHPCE. 2021-06-16 addressing SPEAQeasy error we talked about how to use the “–strand” option, the source of the error that was encountered 2021-05-19 Making a module We went through the creation of an LIBD JHPCE module, covering the documentation process, lua syntax, and how to test a module before pushing. 2021-05-19 Configuring a parallel series of bash scripts We adapted a series of bash scripts requiring parallel functionality for use at JHPCE. This involved correctly setting some path variables and requesting multiple cores through SGE for some scripts. 2021-05-13 Setting up a SPEAQeasy run I described how I typically construct a “samples.manifest” file and configure SPEAQeasy for a particular experiment. 2021-05-03 Running SPEAQeasy- follow up We observed an issue where log parsing in SPEAQeasy behaved differently for Sreya and I due to a difference in default python version loaded at JHPCE. I fixed the hisat2/2.2.1 module to ensure consistent python version use. 2021-04-28 Constructing an array job from an existing sequential shell script I showed how I typically produce an array job shell script for the situation where I have many samples of data to process the same way (SIMD). We talked about using a text file where each line contains one sample name, and referencing that in the array script. 2021-04-26 Running SPEAQeasy- follow up We discussed how to handle strandness issues, and how different inferred strand patterns within a group of samples sequenced together can indicate problems with the input data. I described how to use the ‘–force_strand’ option with SPEAQeasy 2021-04-22 Running SPEAQeasy We went through cloning SPEAQeasy, creating a “samples.manifest” file with R, and other relevant details for running SPEAQeasy at JHPCE. I also helped Henry set up git at JHPCE 2021-04-22 Running SPEAQeasy- follow up We troubleshooted strange errors from the main SPEAQeasy output, and saw that I was able to run the main script (“run_pipeline_jhpce.sh”) but Sreya encountered errors with an identical script. We suspected permissions issues in her working directory, which she emailed bitsupport about. 2021-04-19 Running SPEAQeasy Although we encountered permissions issues, I showed how to create a “samples.manifest” file and configure SPEAQeasy for a particular set of samples. 2021-04-12 Running the old RNA-seq pipeline on some SRA data I showed my typical process for creating a “samples.manifest” file for a given dataset, and how to submit a pipeline run. We continued to debug some minor issues over slack 2021-04-07 Nextflow overview for work with imputation pipeline I covered various nextflow concepts, as well as my typical approach in creating and running a nextflow project at JHPCE 2021-03-22 Using an LIBD module I described the need for the “module use” command and modifying the .bashrc to easily use LIBD modules 2021-03-18 Download SRA data and run SPEAQeasy I fetched the SRA files, created a manifest and execution script for SPEAQeasy, but had an issue running “fastq-dump”. I decided to hand off the request, partially complete. 2021-03-10 qSVA explanation and code review Josh walked me through some code performing qSVA for a recent project, and I offered some tips involving code organization/ readibility. 2021-03-03 Advice for writing papers We discussed how Sciwheel can be adapted for different journals, and provided general advice for getting started and formatting a paper for a particular journal. 2021-03-02 Clarification about how recent CMC data was processed with SPEAQeasy I explained that SPEAQeasy was used for the recent hg38 processing, and an older version of a similar pipeline was used for the original hg19 processing. We discussed our new method for retrieving gene symbols (“org.*.eg.db” packages) and some general code advice. 2021-03-02 Our group’s set-up and approach for writing papers with google docs, and managing citations I went through the setup and example usage of Sciwheel and cross reference, and gave general advice (it’s often easiest to start with the “Methods” section, etc) 2021-02-25 I need help in: downloading data from SRA to JHPCE, running SPEAQeasy to create rse object (one session will likely not be enough). I explained how to use SPEAQeasy at JHPCE, and we tried an experimental method for downloading SRA data. The method didn’t work, and we plan to meet again after I verify a more typical method works. 2021-02-23 I need help with setting up Mobaexterm. Unable to open new terminals and folder permission issues I hadn’t encountered the issue with new local terminals failing to open. I planned to follow up with better specific advice via email, and offer to explain this advice in a future DSGS. 2021-01-06 Correlation values from labeledHeatmap BioC Support website answer 2020-12-09 Help with importing HDF5 file Used ‘h5ls’ command from shell to verify contents of file; eventually found we were looking at the wrong file (error message was cryptic about issue). https://jhu-genomics.slack.com/archives/CUYHWV7AA/p1607034309074800 2020-12-02 Matching Variants Between Two VCF Objects BioC Support website answer 2020-11-20 ChipQC ‘names’ attribute [9] must be the same length as the vector [2]’ BioC Support website answer 2020-11-11 How does one modify a single value of a field in a seqinfo object?
