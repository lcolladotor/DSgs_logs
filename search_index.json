Density is related to the probability density function, see wiki more details. This link is also useful for understanding the y-axis in more detail. Violin plots are just density plots rotated 90 degrees and mirrored. They are compared against boxplots frequently, which while easier to understand, are not good for non-unimodal data. See this link for more. I like plotExplanatoryVariables() because it’s fast to run and gives a general idea of things. See Figure 1b from variancePartition for a violin plot of similar data. variancePartition can handle mixed effects models (random effects) and in that scenario is more precise, but will also take longer to compute. 2022-08-17 DE analysis introduction Check EnchancedVolcano which shows a quick DE guide and finishes with some Volcano plots, which can be good enough for a grant application. If you want to use limma, you could follow the SPEAQeasy example or our DE bootcamp a bit. Or dive deeper into limma’s documentation. 2022-07-19 Help with spatialLIBD colors setup Note that spe$var_colors works for spe$var where the var part has to be the same in both variable names. Also spe$var_colors should be a named vector such that unique(names(spe$var_colors)) matches unique(spe$var). 2022-07-15 R, RStudio, git, SSH key setup NA 2022-07-12 LIBD Data Science NA 2022-07-06 Data science coordination NA 2022-06-03 Tools and resources related to recount2 and recount3 Talked about recount2, recount3, snaptron, snapcount, recount.bwtool, recount-brain, recount predictions, megadepth, the recount3 study explorer. I also sent them all the links to them, though you can find many of them at https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/, https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount-brain/, and http://rna.recount.bio/. 2022-05-27 Debug spatialLIBD::sig_genes_extract_all().

Send links to our deconvolution work with Louise A Huuki-Myers. 2022-04-15 Debugged code from https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD/issues/33 See https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD/issues/33#issuecomment-1100169012. 2022-04-08 macOS and JHPCE laptop set JHPCE ssh keys (to avoid typing passwords when using qrsh), .Rprofile (both), .bashrc, .zshrc (laptop), iTerm2 (laptop), Textmate (laptop), remote port fowading for rmate, xquartz (laptop) installation and configuration. There are several LIBD rstats club videos on these topics already, but we just did all the setup fast. In particular, the .bashrc configuration was important to resolve a umask setting problem that was interfering with the permissions on the Visium IF AD project. 2022-04-08 How to delete large files from GitHub history If the situation had been simple, that is, that the latest commit was the one that commited the large files, we could have used the solution described at http://lcolladotor.github.io/2020/03/18/you-just-committed-a-large-file-and-can-t-push-to-github/. Instead, we had to use https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/. 2022-04-06 Debugging JHPCE configuration files See this Slack thread. Ultimately, this situation involved teaching Tony to share his code. 2022-03-18 The authenticity of host ‘github.com’ I explained how the first time that you ssh into a new computer (which happens also with git pull/git push), you need to accept that the new host is authentic, which will then edit your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. 2022-03-16 Plan how to make spatial registration R functions This is challenging since it involves putting together code from multiple scripts/projects. We summarized the steps to do on this GitHub issue thread. 2022-03-15 Clarifying what role deconvolution can play on LCM-seq Louise and I discussed the Dentate Gyrus, Jaffe at al, 2020 paper which used LCM-seq, what deconvolution using Bisque can do, and what role it can play at different analytical stages. 2022-03-11 How to log in to JHU-controlled laptop We had some trouble logging in because the WiFi wasn’t working without logging in. We solved this by using an ethernet cable at LIBD (which is part of the JHU network). Once we logged in once, then we could use the WiFi. 2022-03-04 How to guide others learning DS I described different strateguies for helping others navigate the world of data science. In particular, how weekly coding sessions can be really useful. 2022-03-04 “Megadepth usage to add a new annotation to hg38 file” Created an R script that reads in the transcripts FASTA file from GENCODE and uses BSgenome from Bioconductor to edit it and save it as a larger .fasta.gz file.

So, the data processing would be “easy” in a sense. Next, you might want to check the bsseq documentation https://bioconductor.org/packages/bsseq/ if you are interested in finding differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and in any case, because BiocMAP provides that type of R object as noted at http://research.libd.org/BiocMAP/outputs.html. https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/wgbsExprs/ and the companion paper is the last WGBS data analysis project I did myself with code at https://github.com/LieberInstitute/brain-epigenomics. Kira Perzel-Mandell, who worked with Shizhong, wrote https://github.com/LieberInstitute/wgbs_meqtl_analysis (link to paper there) and did other projects. If you are plotting methylation levels at some locations, then that’s very direct. If you are trying to find DMRs, it can take a bit of time to get used to the large objects and the related complications (once you filter the data, it’ll be more manageable). If you go into CpH instead of CpG, then memory constraints become harder to deal with. 2022-02-18 Ideas for possible future analyses NA 2022-02-16 JHPCE array jobs and fasthplus Related to JHPCE https://github.com/ntdyjack/fasthplus and http://research.libd.org/sgejobs/ 2022-02-15 snRNA-seq and deconvolution overview Brainstormed several ideas related to deconvolution of bulk data as well as uses of snRNA-seq. Refered to OSCA https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/ at time. 2021-12-06 JHPCE file permissions and ACLs Motivated /dcs04/lieber/lcolladotor/_jhpce_org_LIBD001/update_permissions_spatialteam.sh 2021-10-20 Transfering files between JHPCE disks Explained some scripts such as /dcs04/lieber/lcolladotor/BrainSEQ_LIBD001/_jhpce_org 2021-09-27 Presentation preparation feedback NA 2021-08-06 How to write a Twitter thread for a paper We revised key features of Brenda Pardo’s Twitter thread https://twitter.com/PardoBree/status/1388253938391175173?s=20 and some features that you would want your Twitter thread to have. 2021-08-03 Refining an abstract submission We talked about all the details that go into writing an abstract for a conference. These details can take longer to complete than initially anticipated. 2021-07-30 Git branches We revised how to make a new branch in Git working with https://github.com/lmweber/OSTA-book 2021-07-28 DNA genotyping overview We discussed the current DNA genotype pipeline and potential changes others might want. 2021-07-20 Overview of the RNA-seq universe From SPEAQeasy, to qSVA, deconvolution, TWAS, etc. It might be best to give a talk about all these topics to whoever is interested at LIBD since we know about all these pieces but others might not. 2021-07-13 Setting up a team at LIBD We talked about https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/ among other topics. 2021-07-01 How to set up a GitHub actions-powered website This has changed over time. The most recent setup (as of 2021-08-06) is at https://github.com/lmweber/OSTA-book 2021-06-29 How to choose and add a licence to a GitHub repo We talked about https://choosealicense.com/, https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository, https://creativecommons.org/choose/. 2021-06-29 Designing an MS-level class We discussed the posibility of proposing a class that has a mix of biology lectures and some practical coding sessions. The coding sessions could be based after the CDSB 2021 mini courses series. 2021-06-29 Planning session for getting up to speed with SpatialExperiment, spatialLIBD, here and ggplot2 We talked about the set of videos and resources publicly available to get to learn about R, Bioconductor and these packages. It was a lot of information and I’m sure that we’ll have more sessions later on to clarify questions as they arise. 2021-06-21 Locating public data at JHPCE + bamtofastq workflow We talked about the public data from Synapse and worked on locating some of it at JHPCE. I explained also how we have used bamtofastq when others don’t share their FASTQ files. Basically, we use bamtofastq to reconstruct the original FASTQ files (you might have to append the unmapped FASTQs if they are provided by the original authors) and then run FASTQ-processing tools like our SPEAQeasy pipeline. 2021-06-17 Brainstorming session on collaboration I showed the initial version of the BrainSeq Phase II developmental expression explorer developed by Bill Ulrich and Aaron Goldman. We discussed other possibilities for the collaboration including helping set up SPEAQeasy in their servers. 2021-06-17 How to transfer recount3 data We met to figure out how to transfer the data for this collaboration, which ended up being quite tricky and involved using an SSH tunnel for rsync. Basically, a command like this one: rsync -avzh -e 'ssh -o ProxyJump=user@server_somewhere_for_the_tunnel' *_files_of_interest user@final_server:/final_path/ 2021-06-17 How to get started with R We discussed the different possible goals and ways to get to them and determined a path forward that relies on the rest of the DSgs system as well as existing LIBD rstats club videos to get started. It’ll be supported by a meeting with Leo and others involved in the spatial transcriptomics projects from the R side. 2021-06-02 How to prepare for a LIBD seminar part 4 We discussed the changes that we should make and the ones we shouldn’t based on the feedback received from the practice talk with Keri’s group. The feedback was excellent and very useful, however, we discussed which suggestions were maybe complicating the presentation too much and how to best incorporate them. 2021-05-26 How to prepare for a LIBD seminar part 3 Similar to part 2. The presentation was looking very polished by this meeting! 2021-05-24 Grant application review Helped review the grant application and revise the text. 2021-05-21 PredictDB weights Further updates on asking for help with this complicated project. Suggested reaching out to other LIBD members who have tried running the software before. 2021-05-20 How to prepare for a LIBD seminar part 2 Now that a first major draft of the presentation was complete, we revised it and proposed some changes to it. Some of them involved remaking the figures using base_size = 20 or even 30 with ggplot2. For future work, it might be best to save the images with that font size from the beginning instead of having to update them later. 2021-05-20 Help preparing a figure for a grant application Discussed with Josh what figures we needed to prepare and how to generate them. This also involved base_size = 30 with ggplot2. Otherwise the font was too small to read it on the grant. 2021-05-10 Setting up covr using GitHub actions in an R package We went over the details of the GitHub actions workflow created by biocthis, the parts that you need to run from biocthis::use_bioc_pkg_templates(), and resolving issues prompted by R CMD check + BiocCheck 2021-05-07 How to get started with computational biology I gave an overview of the resources and materials we have created as well as the LIBD bootcamps that we have publicly available to help others get started with computational biology. This is likely the first of several meetings. 2021-05-07 How to insert a figure using the Oxford Bioinfomratics Overleaf LaTeX template We spent a significant amount troubleshooting the problem here (nearly two hours?). In the end, using the insert image “here” LaTeX syntax resolved the problem. 2021-05-06 How to prepare for a LIBD seminar Initial planning session for the LIBD seminar. We talked about the different slides we planned to show and the flow of the presentation. We also scheduled 3 practice talks with different groups of people. 2021-05-06 PredictDB weights General advice on how to ask for help from open source projects 2021-05-03 TWAS prep Overview of the TWAS pipeline 2021-04-08 General guidance on how to learn how to do differential expression analyses Created a learning plan involving several team members that is now documented at a channel in JHU Genomics Slack. That way everyone can keep track of what others are teaching the person who asked the question, and we can have a common communication channel among everyone involved. Sessions include learning how to interact with JHPCE through RStudio, how to run SPEAQeasy, key R/Bioconductor packages (limma, SummarizedExperiment), and explore possible visualizations of interest. 2021-03-29 spatialLIBD support Discussion about features that spatialLIBD could support to make it easier to use for newer data. 2021-03-25 Creating a documentation website using bookdown Help with understanding bookdown and ideas on how to organize a documentation website (chapters and information to consider). 2021-03-25 Clarification of LIBD support Discussed the research project proposal and how we can help. 2021-03-25 General advice General advice. Received feedback regarding file backups. 2021-03-24 Download SRA data and run SPEAQeasy I identified that https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154829 contains both miRNA and RNA-seq data. Using data from the SRA Run selector at https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP273137&amp;o=acc_s%3Aa I was able to filter the data to the RNA-seq samples and subset the input samples.manifest file for SPEAQeasy. 2021-03-24 Explain the feasibility of an on-demand end user interface for DEG and eQTLs To identify DEGs or eQTLs, the user has to choose what covariates to adjust for. Some studies might require more complicated models than others, as they might be from more than one brain region or present some batch effect. In addition, in newer projects we are considering adjusting for cell type fractions derived from deconvolution. Even if all the covariates were fixed across datasets, in DEGs we have typically adjusted for qSVs which are computed in a dataset-dependent fashion and in essence are PCs derived from degradation-associated genomic regions. Similarly, for eQTLs we adjust for expression PCs. In both we adjust for ancestry PCs. Computing PCs is input-dependent: you won’t get the same values or PCs if you change which samples you are using. So, computing DEGs and eQTLs is not as simple as say a map-reduce problem where you compute the same thing for every input sample, then aggregate the per-sample results. We have steps that depend on the whole sample set. Then there’s also steps for filtering expression features based on some minimum expression cutoffs. Plus, differences between say polyA and RiboZero data, which don’t make sense to process together. For these reasons, I don’t think that an on-demand computation pipeline is feasible based on a user selecting a set of input samples. Constructing RNA-seq objects (RangedSummarizedExperiment objects) as well as DNA genotyping VCF files based on a set of input samples is feasible and that’s what others are building. After that, I think that it’s best to adapt code we have (or even use newer tools) after carefully exploring the data. 2021-03-11 BSP2 eQTLs with a subset of SNPs Adapted code and shared it at https://github.com/LieberInstitute/brainseq_phase2/tree/master/eQTL_full/subset_hancock 2021-03-10 How to write a small methods paper Created GitHub issues at https://github.com/LieberInstitute/VisiumImgProcessing/issues 2021-02-05 BSP2 LIBD eQTLs request NA 2021-01-29 Help determining what data is available and what can be used for an analysis Use of galaxybrain for identifying samples with DNAm, DNA genotype and RNA-seq data 2021-01-26 Guidance on how to download data from a study in GEO NA 2021-01-14 biocthis macOS GHA bug BioC Support website answer 2021-01-11 Questions related to accessing results from the DG paper by Andrew Jaffe NA 2020-11-25 Accesing CMC RNA-seq data Started PsychENCODE access request process 2020-11-11 GitHub actions workflow issue with macOS on R-devel GitHub issue at biocthis 2020-11-11 Differences between recount2’s “bp_length” and SPEAQeasy’s “Length” Check Slack helpdesk channel 2020-11-03 Issue with knitcitations GitHub issue at biocthis 2020-11-03 Fixed a bug on biocthis for release branches GitHub issue at biocthis 2020-11-03 Fixed two bugs on recount3 related to locate_url() for the BigWig files.

Created psuedobulk data for three different clustering methods, and went over the basic process of making heatmaps. Bukola will work on the aestetics of the heatmaps, and cerate one for all thee clustering methods. 2023-02-17 Setting up .bashrc file for folder access permission for DLPFC-SCZ project related to my meeting with Uma on 2/10. We fixed Boyi’s bashrc to allow group write by deafult, fixing the ,git issue and eliminating the need to re-run the permission update script often 2023-02-10 I have questions on GitHub and submitting SGE jobs. Uma was having file permission issues, the group permissions for several files in a shared project were set to read only. This was causing issues with the team using scripts but also in making git commits as some of the idex files in .git were read-only. We updated her bashrc files to contain “umask u=rwx,g=rwx,o= ## equivalent to umask 007” to prevent this in the future and ran the premissoin update script. 2023-02-09 Moving forward with multiple cluster methods Bukola hads run muliple clustering methods on the habenula data, I advised she pick the two that were the most simmlar to ERiks previous annotations (we were happy with) via rand index, and start examining marker gene expression. 2023-01-19 GitHub for a beginner Hope created a github account and I talked her thuogth the basics of git, But we hit a snag with the instalation of git on her laptop, git is built in to xcode in the ventura OS (which her machine is running) but she had some trouble with that instalation too. Shes going to try and fix that independtly, and reasch out if she needs more help gettign off hte ground with git + github 2023-01-18 snRNA-seq GLM PCA We adapted code from the DLPFC work and https://www.stephaniehicks.com/biocdemo/articles/Demo.html to run GLM-PCA to prep for batch correction 2023-01-13 snRNA-seq QC Bukola and I adapted QC code for the habenula data 2023-01-11 Plotting Gene Expression with SCE Continuing Sreyas work with the single cell mouse data, I pointed her towards scater::plotExpression to plot some of the genes her group is intested in observing by cell type. However we ran in to some bugs with running logNormCounts which we think is from an old version of R. I advised that she update R and re-install the packages, hopefull that will fix the issue. 2023-01-04 Help building SCE with downloaded data I helped Sreya build a single cell experiment object with expression and metadata csvs she had from an publication. Hopefully she can use this to independently explore the gene expression her group is interested in. 2022-12-14 Discuss Mean Ratio marker gene finding Hedia wanted some background information about the deconvolution process we applied to the degradation data. I explained the mean ratio marker finding, the resulting stats, and how we ued them to build our set of marker genes. Then the script for how we ran bisque + the output of bisque . 2022-12-14 Deconvolution study with rnaseq bulk data Sreya wants to test if a gene of intrest to her group is associaited with a ceratain cell type. They are working with bulk mouse data. I suggested that deconvolution may not be able to answer theire innital question but can provide depth to their bulk analysis. I suggested that they find a mouse single cell dataset that is relevant to their current data set, then first observe their gene of interest their, see if that answers any questions. Then they could use that data to run deconvioltion with bisuqe (I suggested a follow up meeting if she needs guidance with this) 2022-11-30 Understanding PCA for Habenula project We discussed how PCA reduces the dimesions of our data and helps show the variance between samples. I helped Bukola strategize how to make PCA plots for the habenula data. Start plotting the first 5 PCs pairwise, color by Dx. Then explore key QC or demographic variables, see if we can indentify any patterns. I was unsure if she should repeat this for exon, jx, tx, as we didnt for MDDseq. But figured gene was a good place to start and if the other features should be explored too, the code should be easily adapatabe. 2022-11-30 Review deconvolition script for qSVA I gave Hedia a breif overview of the goals and process of deconvolution, including mean ratio marker finding. I linked my deconvolution slides. We then went over the code for running bisque on the qSVA dataset, including details of the input, refrence, and output data. 2022-11-03 help submitting jobs with R parallelization in jhpce. For instance, I would like to use scater::runPCA with the BPPARAM=BiocParallel::MulticoreParam(8)) parameter Tricia is trying to run glmPCA on the very large MDD snRNA-seq dataset. She has a run submitted without parallelization that has been runing for 3 days. To try and speed things up she has been trying to use BioCparrallel, via MulticoreParam. But the scheduler keeps killing her job. We checked that -pe local X and MulticoreParam(X) match , so it wasn’t that. I recomended she try to run a subset of the data to get a sense of how glmPCA uses memory. But couldn’t come up with a fix to make the parallelization work. As its PCA it also can’t be run as subsets, so there aren’t other workarounds :( I think BioCparallel + sge scheduling would be a good topic for Rstats club as this seems to be a common headache 2022-10-27 I have this single nucleus RNA sequencing experiment with the mouse LS that Matt analyzed and we have a final single cell experiment, but I don’t know how to do anything with this data set and want to learn how to plot heatmaps and possibly other things for this data set. Can we maybe schedule an hour to start this learning process and then I can schedule future time as needed? Lionel walked me through some plots they need for the LS paper: marker genes heatmap and expression violin plots. I pointed him to some code from DLPFC sn that should be helpful (he needs access to this repo). He also needs to get setup with JHPCE on his new laptop, I pointed him to the team laptop setup docs. He also is new to ggplot, so I pointed him to the visulization chapeter of R for data scientist. This will probaly require some follow up meetings 2022-10-26 Check the DEG heatmaps Daianna has added a new color scheme to the heatmaps that makes the differnces between positive and negative more clear, how ever I think the darkest red being close to 0 is misleading, so shes going to fix that. I also recomended she simplify the annotaions on the combined heatmap so its easier to find and interpret patterns. 2022-10-17 Review TMM paper We reviewed the reasons or correcting counts and why thats important for DE analysis. We went over the math behind TMM, and then how thoes ideas are used in edgeR. I pointed Bukola to a stats quest video with a more detatiled explination of how the edgeR correction works. 2022-10-14 csvs that I want to merge together Sang Ho showed me the csv files that he exported from different moduled on HALO. They seem to have the same rows, so copying the needed column in to a differnt csv is easy in excel (where Sang Ho is working) but I showed him how to check that things are really aligned with some excel functions. We also looked at the data in prism, which I had to quickly learned about. I advised that he should show the data in boxplots not as a barplot to better display that data, and went over the checks for running an anova. 2022-10-11 GO and KEGG boxplots with the modifications you suggested Daianna showed me her dot plots with the correct 0.05 q val filter, they looked good, ready for discussion. One tweak , is hshe had a combined up + down expresion col for some plots which was redundant and should be removed. She had also made some heatmaps that didn;t show very much difference between case control, htey probaly need to be normalized by the genes overall expression, but I need to check prevous work to remeber how to best do that 2022-10-10 QC approach for hebenula We went throught boxplots Bukola had made for the data, I suggested she add geom_jitter and how to make that work with geom_repel to help show more details about the data. We also discussed direct vs. standard evaluation of variable and how that makes writing funcitons with tidyverse tricky, but how she can use aes_() to do stadard eval with ggplot 2022-10-05 How to check technical effects for RNAseq data I walked Bukola through our process for buld data QC, which involves making many exploratory plots of QC metrics and know groups (like batch, or case/control) to understand patterns and identify problematics samples. Then later implementing cutoff values either based on stats (like a 3 MAD cut off) or knowlege of ressonable values. Bukola will spend some time plotting QC values, adapting code from smoking mouse, then we will meet again to interpret these plots. 2022-10-05 Reviewing GO results and dotplots Daianna and I went over the dot plots she made for GO analysis from the multiple DE test she ran. Her plots look good, but we identified that she needed to use the default q cutoff to get useful results. She will rerun the GO analysis and replot the results. 2022-09-30 Question on the feasibility of some approach with HALO (for the AD project) Sang Ho walked me through an analysis they want to do for the AD project, it involves annotating HALO data. We talked thought a strategy, this may be a bit computationally tricky to implement but it seems doable. 2022-09-30 Working on making a violin plot for just one gene. So by brain region rather than gene type We adapted my_plotExpression() (a function I wrote) to work for Bukola’s data. This required some debugging as subsetting to just the one gene in question altered how some internal dataframes looked. I also gave Bukola some pointers about saving plots using ggplot. 2022-08-22 DE analysis introduction I went over the DE pipeline we use, noting that the model development is the most demanding and non-static part. We talked specifics for their dataset which has some experimental design to consider as its organids and is diffrent from patient case control. I posinted Geo to scripts where we do QC, expression cutoff, and my run_DE script 2022-08-18 Git push help Heena saw old commits pop up on slacks git notifications when she pushed commits she had locally on her laptop, but they didn’t reappear in the git history. I think she did everything right and there might be something strange with the behavior of the slack message (as thats the only place things seemd wrong). We did some detective work between the files and the commits, everything seems good. Heena was able to then pull to the cluster with out conflicts 2022-08-17 check the models and the results I have obtained so far from the DEA Had to work over slack again as Daianna was having trouble with zoom. Working with the feedback from the previous meetings, the experimetn has been narrowed down to 5 DE runs, and then comparing some pairs of the outputs. We were unsure if we should include mitoRate as a variable in the adult model as it correlates highly with totalAssignedGene, but decided to include it for now to match the model used in the pup DEA. I also sent her some code I have used to make scatter plots of t-stats to help compare DE results. 2022-08-10 Check the model design of the smoking mouse project We intended to meet on zoom, but Daianna’s connection was bad so we used Slack to chat. Daianna has made many plots and visuals about the many DE analysis for smoking mouse. I gave her some feedback about orgaizing her slides so the figures can practically be used inform DE models, right now everything is a bit scattered as shes planning on running 7 analysis so there is a lot to consider. We will need to meet again to finish this. 2022-08-03 Review results of Varaince Parition for smoking mouse Daianna showed me her varianceParition plots, and we talked bout how to design the DE anlaysis based on what she’s oberved in the mouse data. I advised to keep things simpler (ie not create too many groups) but rather use models to control for vaiables adding variance. We will meet next to talk model design for this work. 2022-07-15 QC update for smoking mouse Daianna shared her updated QC plots, adn the one sample she planned to drop based on fastCellQC. I advised that she dig deeper in to how that QC finstion works, and what the cutoff values are, as well as exmaming mito vs. ribo precentages, and a two samples that don’t seem to group with others of the same phenotype / 2022-07-07 Subsetting eQTL results with in risk loci We discussed a strategy to subset the 102 loci in question, and adapted code to subset the FDR signif pairs to work with the location info. 2022-07-07 help row annotation colors of a pheatmap I explained how to get pheatmap to use the same color scheme for column and row annotations by making the annotaion tables have the same colname, and suppying a color pallet 2022-07-05 QC update for smoking mouse Daianna shared the updates she made to the QC plots based on our previous discussion, specifically separating brain and blood samples. 2022-06-28 Review progress on smoking mouse DE project Daianna walked me through her progress in the DE analysis. We went over QC plots and discussed experimental design. She will check in with Kristen about how to organize the brain vs. blood samples. Currently she dropped the blood sampeles as they looked very different in several QC metrics. But I advised that they just be handled seperatly as it makes senese they look different as they are different tissue, and the signal is probaly biological rather than technical 2022-06-17 JHPCE Github setup We fixed Sanjana’s ssh set up and got the qrsh command working. We got git configurated for her locally and on JHPCE, as well as set up tokens. Created a test repo, and made commits from her laptop and JHPCE as an example 2022-06-15 Revisited the sc analysis and could use some help We checked Sreya’s code against the OSCA DE example run. She was worried that there weren’t may significant genes, but her results seemed to be in the same range (10s of genes) as the example. We discussed how maybe there were QC or demographic variables that could have been added to the model, but the data she has doesn’t have much to work with. We will revisit when I have maybe done more work with sn DE analysis. 2022-06-15 Github setup We went over github basics and motivation behind version control. Quickly discovered that Sanjana’s qrsh command is not working, requiring a password. Ended up using the session to troubleshoot that, with no success :( planning on circling back/re-setting up ssh for her. Will meet later about git setup 2022-06-03 I might need a review of how to go about selecting marker genes for the spatialDLPFC data. Also, I’m curious what code you have for making heatmaps showing marker gene expression across cell types. I pointed Nick to a few scripts used in marker finding for the Tran Maynard dataset, using a few functions from DeconvoBuddies. For marker heat maps we went over how I hace built annotation tables, and a few tricks for optimizing pheatmaps for maker plots. 2022-06-02 Single cell rna seq analysis We converted a downloaded dataset from tsv files to a sce object.

As we as troublshooting the plot functions from the SPEAQeasy bootcamp code. I also advised taht she could create a volcano plot for her results. 2021-05-12 Making plots for DE studies We went over some plots we have made for DE previously, (quality control &amp; PC scatter plots, t-stat scatter between models, venn diagrams, and boxplots). Talked about some things to watch out for in her data (small samples size). We are planning to meet again when her data is ready. 2021-04-19 JHPCE set up on mac We got ssh key login working, added config files to JHPCE, went though a “hello world” example of using files on JHPCE on RStudio 2021-04-15 JHPCE set up on mac Henry needed to reset his JHPCE password as he had forgotten it, but we went through RStudio set up and got cyberduck installed, we will set up a meeting next week for ssh keys and configuration 2021-03-26 Need help understanding the sce - single cell object Went over basic functions of SummarizedExperiment and SingleCellExperiment, what a Sparse matrix is - how to convert to non-sparse.

We solved the problem by setting up a new key pair using the recommended Ed25519 algorithm instead of the deprecated RSA algorithm. 2023-01-20 SPEAQeasy error We identifed that SPEAQeasy cannot handle runs with only one sample, but that the intention was to use multiple samples (the manifest did not use unique sample names) 2023-01-18 Integrating R scripts with Nextflow We went over several concepts in Nextflow (e.g. processes and channels) and discussed how to invoke R scripts inside processes. 2023-01-10 Help identify the source of unexpected NA values We uncovered the source of some unwanted NA values in some genotyping data and eliminated it by removing some code 2022-12-06 resolving a merge conflict I described the manual process for resolving a merge conflict with git when git cannot automatically merge two branches 2022-12-05 Identifying the source of an error We pinpointed an error message as being due to trying to find the ‘colData’ of a list containing Summarized Experiments rather than calling ‘colData’ on the SummarizedExperiment itself 2022-12-01 coloring plots by a continuous variable I described how to color ggplot2 plots by a continuous variable, adjust the palette, and other ggplot-related syntax/tricks 2022-11-30 wrangling and reformatting expression data I recommended some data-preprocessing steps for later downstream manipulation of the data 2022-11-23 preprocessing and reformatting genotype and expression data I gave general advice for how to preprocess some data, including changing data types, transposing matrices, and dropping columns to format things for a collaborator 2022-11-16 organizing plots and output files I described ‘facet_wrap’ and showed that for some situations, ‘plot_grid’ with a single output PDF (with width and height scaled appropriately) does well 2022-11-15 understanding linear mixed-effects models We generally discussed linear mixed effects models and some common terms used as fixed effects in genomic data 2022-10-28 formatting genotype data into a matrix for each gene I described how to transpose matrices, change their type, drop columns, and related tricks to solve a data-formatting problem asked by a collaborator 2022-10-13 Lifting results between hg19 and hg38 I mentioned rtracklayer::liftOver and showed a code example of lifting over genomic coordinates for a SummarizedExperiment 2022-09-26 Setting up SSH keys between login and compute nodes I described the need for SSH keys between the login and compute nodes at JHPCE, and how an incorrect set-up will manifest as a prompt for your password when using ‘qrsh’. I referenced https://jhpce.jhu.edu/knowledge-base/authentication/ssh-key-setup/ 2022-09-23 Setting up SSH keys for JHPCE We debugged her SSH set-up with JHCPE, finding a syntax mistake, confirming the contents of the ‘.ssh/config’ file, and other details to ultimately get the traditional RStudio + JHPCE set-up working smoothly. We touched a bit on the process for using git from JHPCE but didn’t finish fully setting things up 2022-09-16 Interaction between .bashrc and ‘module load’ in ’qsub’d scripts I described how ‘module load conda_R’ lines in a submitted shell script override the default version of R that can be loaded by default using the ‘.bashrc’. In this case this undesired interaction caused a corrupted R package to load and return an error 2022-09-16 Modifying a shell script to segment a VCF by genomic region We adapted someone else’s code, slightly changing some awk commands to use cut (which I’m more familiar with) and using a for loop rather than piping a file to a while loop. This allowed the code to work as intended on the data 2022-09-12 Setting up SPEAQeasy at JHPCE I pointed to installation guidelines for the cluster to resolve issues about R packages not being installed and a problematic nextflow version. 2022-08-24 Use of git from multiple local locations I described how to smoothly ‘git pull’ when updates have been made to both the local and remote repo (adding + committing local changes, running ‘git pull’, and handling a smooth merge) 2022-08-22 Moving and correctly accessing HDF5-backed SummarizedExperiments I described proper saving and loading of SummarizedExperiment derivatives whose assays are HDF5-backed using the HDF5Array package, and how to convert between HDF5-backed objects and “ordinary” in-memory objects 2022-07-18 CUDA issues with cellpose module We worked through a few issues in the cellpose module, which each had a different cause. In one case, the version of torch/CUDA was outdated for the hardware. In another case, user-specific libraries were being referenced instead of the central module’s libraries. 2022-07-13 Addressing SPEAQeasy error messages The error messages involved a mismatch between sample ID and file name for the ‘QualityTrimmed’ process, as well as a supposed missing ID in the manifest (which was actually present). Simply resuming the pipeline got rid of both errors. 2022-07-06 Setting up SPEAQeasy I described how to configure SPEAQeasy for a particular dataset, and how to manage two separate runs of SPEAQeasy as part of a different git repository (requiring the use of submodules) 2022-07-01 Question about how ‘mitoRate’ is calculated in SPEAQeasy I showed the documentation’s description of ‘mitoRate’ and linked to the code where it’s computed: https://github.com/LieberInstitute/SPEAQeasy/blob/bfe4e664281b52c5e239e372393a8aea36084e0d/scripts/create_count_objects.R#L521-L533 2022-06-29 zellkonverter error and guidance using SpaGCN I described the need to manually convert some spatialExperiment slots prior to conversion with zellkonverter, and that some data types are not supported. I pointed to my SpaGCN code and the lines specifically responsible for clustering + writing outputs 2022-06-23 pulling in external changes to a git repository I described when ‘git pull’ can be “safely” used, and when ‘git reset’ might have to be used beforehand 2022-06-21 help installing ‘jaffelab’ I described the use of ‘remotes::install_github’ for GitHub-based packages. We encountered a GitHub authentication error that was solved by running the R code ‘Sys.unsetenv(“GITHUB_PAT”)’ prior to the normal installation command. 2022-05-05 Guide to creating a module at JHPCE I described the two JHPCE-based repositories we push to (https://github.com/LieberInstitute/jhpce_mod_source and https://github.com/LieberInstitute/jhpce_module_config), my usual installation approach for python-based GPU-utilizing software, and the contents of the lua-based config enabling a module to load. 2022-04-29 creating a nextflow pipeline and supporting docker I clarified the usage of nextflow channels, described when docker integration is likely to be worthwhile, and answered other general questions about processing data with a nextflow-based workflow 2022-04-01 Using the “redstone” software After identifying that ‘redstone’ was a precompiled binary for Linux, I described how to use ‘wget’ to download software like this, set execute permissions if necessary, and run at JHPCE. 2022-03-25 Input files for custom annotation with SPEAQeasy I recommended some adjustments to a custom GTF and transcripts FASTA to solve an error seen in SPEAQeasy where transcripts and annotation were found to be incompatible. 2022-03-17 Follow-up on custom annotation with SPEAQeasy An error occurred in a SPEAQeasy run, which I identified to be due to not providing all the required inputs (specifically the sites at which to perform variant calling) 2022-03-16 Adding lines to a GTF for use in SPEAQeasy with custom annotation We both verified additional transcript annotation added to a GENCODE GTF looked good for use as input to SPEAQeasy 2022-03-14 Error message running SPEAQeasy An error occurred in the counts step, which I discovered was a bug in some filename-matching code 2022-03-09 Setting up passwordless login I described two-factor authentication vs. passwordless login via SSH keys, and gave tips to set up the latter. 2022-03-09 Using custom annotation with SPEAQeasy I described how to add additional transcripts to the relevant FASTA file then use SPEAQeasy’s custom annotation option to use the new FASTA with the other default annotation files. 2022-03-04 Using the caracol queue I described how requesting ‘caracol’ is similar to requesting ‘bluejay’, but elaborated on additional complications, like contention for the same GPU and using CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES properly, including with array jobs 2022-03-02 Generating bigWigs with SPEAQeasy I referred her to the ‘–coverage’ option with SPEAQeasy, which unfortunately cannot be run alone, which might be useful for an already-processed dataset 2022-02-07 Debugging seg fault with tensorqtl module We tried to discover the source of a seg fault that would occur when she imported tensorqtl in python with the tensorqtl module. Another user and I weren’t able to replicate the issue. We later discovered that there were lines in her .bashrc that might’ve interfered with the module to produce the issue. 2022-02-04 Using tensorqtl with a GPU I described how to qrsh/sub jobs with the GPU node, including how to automatically set up ‘CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES’ to avoid contention for resources, and how to use the tensorqtl module to ensure GPUs were used when importing pytorch 2022-02-04 X11 and SSH issues After ensuring our apparent Rstudio set-ups on our windows machines matched, she still wasn’t able to forward X11 while using Rstudio. Regarding a different issue, we discovered that a particular machine required additional lines in the ‘~/.ssh/config’ to properly enable RSA keys. 2022-01-21 accessing the ‘gpu’ node at JHPCE correctly I described how it’s accessed as a queue, but some manual work is left to the user (checking which GPUs are open and setting ‘CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES’) 2021-12-15 creating a ‘samples.manifest’ and choosing trimming settings I described how I normally deduce sample IDs from FASTQ filenames when creating a ‘samples.manifest’ file for SPEAQeasy, described the difference between ‘–trim_mode’ settings that SPEAQeasy supports, and showed how to check what samples were trimmed. 2021-11-17 using ‘list.files’ in R I described using regular expressions in R to match files in a directory. We encountered a weird case where ‘list.files’ seemed to return different numbers of matched files when run repeatedly. After ensuring we were in the right directory, the issue went away, but it was unclear what caused the original problem. 2021-10-06 help with git I explained how I get out of the situation where files that are too big get accidentally committed (using ‘git log’, ‘git reset –soft’, and other details) 2021-10-04 debugging SPEAQeasy errors We worked through an error message from the ‘VariantsMerge’ process, uncovering (arguably) a bug in SPEAQeasy, and I advised how to temporarily circumvent the problem. I also suggested a command for renaming a set of files that initially broke SPEAQeasy’s assumptions. 2021-09-22 help with ‘umask’ and git I talked about how Linux does not allow creation of files w/ execution permissions set, regardless of ‘umask’ settings such as in the ‘.bashrc’. I also explained how I use branching with git and other tips for managing a repo that others also develop on. 2021-09-10 merging FASTQ files automatically via SPEAQeasy We downloaded a metadata table from SRA and parsed it through R to programatically create a “samples.manifest” file for use in SPEAQeasy, that merged samples that were each split into multiple FASTQ files. 2021-09-03 identifying SPEAQeasy error SPEAQeasy would appear to run into “file not found” errors for just a handful of random samples in a large dataset. I eventually traced the error to a disk mounting issue on a particular compute node, which was resolved through bitsupport. 2021-08-26 resuming SPEAQeasy after an issue in the counts step I mentioned that she encountered a bug that was fixed in a more recent version of SPEAQeasy, but suggested she manually add a line of code temporarily so that she could resume the run before updating 2021-08-25 downloading FASTQ files from SRA I referred her to a script I had written in the past that contains the required commands and configuration (with comments) for using the SRA toolkit 2021-08-06 Forming a data frame from data in multiple files I showed a fairly standard method for concatenating tabular data from multiple files into a single matrix, and saving the resulting R object 2021-07-14 getting SPEAQeasy running In a series of email exchanges we diagnosed subtle errors resulting from bad FASTQ files and unintended options in the main script. Her feedback helped me improve some existing documentation. 2021-07-14 debugging SPEAQeasy errors I described correct use of the “–input” argument, and we also found that many of the input FASTQs were empty, leading to a somewhat vague error message. 2021-07-13 formatting a LaTeX document and bookdown website I attempted some formatting tricks to eliminate unwanted whitespace but was ultimately unsuccessful. We suspected the LaTeX template required the whitespace to exist. We also tried to fix a bug with the header of a bookdown RMD not rendering as expected. It seemed that re-writing the header (without making any visible changes) fixed the issue, though we weren’t sure of the source of the initial problem. 2021-07-02 Help indexing a possibly corrupt VCF file We confirmed that an existing VCF was corrupt and found that tabix expected bgzip-compressed VCF input rather than compressed BCF input. 2021-06-30 Specifying output logs on SGE I briefly mentioned the “#$ -o” and “#$ -e” arguments, and how several logs will generate in your home directory without those arguments and without “#$ -cwd”, when “qsub”ing a job at JHPCE. 2021-06-16 addressing SPEAQeasy error we talked about how to use the “–strand” option, the source of the error that was encountered 2021-05-19 Making a module We went through the creation of an LIBD JHPCE module, covering the documentation process, lua syntax, and how to test a module before pushing. 2021-05-19 Configuring a parallel series of bash scripts We adapted a series of bash scripts requiring parallel functionality for use at JHPCE. This involved correctly setting some path variables and requesting multiple cores through SGE for some scripts. 2021-05-13 Setting up a SPEAQeasy run I described how I typically construct a “samples.manifest” file and configure SPEAQeasy for a particular experiment. 2021-05-03 Running SPEAQeasy- follow up We observed an issue where log parsing in SPEAQeasy behaved differently for Sreya and I due to a difference in default python version loaded at JHPCE. I fixed the hisat2/2.2.1 module to ensure consistent python version use. 2021-04-28 Constructing an array job from an existing sequential shell script I showed how I typically produce an array job shell script for the situation where I have many samples of data to process the same way (SIMD). We talked about using a text file where each line contains one sample name, and referencing that in the array script. 2021-04-26 Running SPEAQeasy- follow up We discussed how to handle strandness issues, and how different inferred strand patterns within a group of samples sequenced together can indicate problems with the input data. I described how to use the ‘–force_strand’ option with SPEAQeasy 2021-04-22 Running SPEAQeasy We went through cloning SPEAQeasy, creating a “samples.manifest” file with R, and other relevant details for running SPEAQeasy at JHPCE. I also helped Henry set up git at JHPCE 2021-04-22 Running SPEAQeasy- follow up We troubleshooted strange errors from the main SPEAQeasy output, and saw that I was able to run the main script (“run_pipeline_jhpce.sh”) but Sreya encountered errors with an identical script. We suspected permissions issues in her working directory, which she emailed bitsupport about. 2021-04-19 Running SPEAQeasy Although we encountered permissions issues, I showed how to create a “samples.manifest” file and configure SPEAQeasy for a particular set of samples. 2021-04-12 Running the old RNA-seq pipeline on some SRA data I showed my typical process for creating a “samples.manifest” file for a given dataset, and how to submit a pipeline run. We continued to debug some minor issues over slack 2021-04-07 Nextflow overview for work with imputation pipeline I covered various nextflow concepts, as well as my typical approach in creating and running a nextflow project at JHPCE 2021-03-22 Using an LIBD module I described the need for the “module use” command and modifying the .bashrc to easily use LIBD modules 2021-03-18 Download SRA data and run SPEAQeasy I fetched the SRA files, created a manifest and execution script for SPEAQeasy, but had an issue running “fastq-dump”. I decided to hand off the request, partially complete. 2021-03-10 qSVA explanation and code review Josh walked me through some code performing qSVA for a recent project, and I offered some tips involving code organization/ readibility. 2021-03-03 Advice for writing papers We discussed how Sciwheel can be adapted for different journals, and provided general advice for getting started and formatting a paper for a particular journal. 2021-03-02 Clarification about how recent CMC data was processed with SPEAQeasy I explained that SPEAQeasy was used for the recent hg38 processing, and an older version of a similar pipeline was used for the original hg19 processing. We discussed our new method for retrieving gene symbols (“org.*.eg.db” packages) and some general code advice. 2021-03-02 Our group’s set-up and approach for writing papers with google docs, and managing citations I went through the setup and example usage of Sciwheel and cross reference, and gave general advice (it’s often easiest to start with the “Methods” section, etc) 2021-02-25 I need help in: downloading data from SRA to JHPCE, running SPEAQeasy to create rse object (one session will likely not be enough). I explained how to use SPEAQeasy at JHPCE, and we tried an experimental method for downloading SRA data. The method didn’t work, and we plan to meet again after I verify a more typical method works. 2021-02-23 I need help with setting up Mobaexterm. Unable to open new terminals and folder permission issues I hadn’t encountered the issue with new local terminals failing to open. I planned to follow up with better specific advice via email, and offer to explain this advice in a future DSGS. 2021-01-06 Correlation values from labeledHeatmap BioC Support website answer 2020-12-09 Help with importing HDF5 file Used ‘h5ls’ command from shell to verify contents of file; eventually found we were looking at the wrong file (error message was cryptic about issue). https://jhu-genomics.slack.com/archives/CUYHWV7AA/p1607034309074800 2020-12-02 Matching Variants Between Two VCF Objects BioC Support website answer 2020-11-20 ChipQC ‘names’ attribute [9] must be the same length as the vector [2]’ BioC Support website answer 2020-11-11 How does one modify a single value of a field in a seqinfo object?
