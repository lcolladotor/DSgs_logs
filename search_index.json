DSgs-guide team members Arta Seyedian Joshua M. Stolz Louise Huuki Nicholas J. Eagles Madhavi Tippani Graphs Below we see the number of DSgs sessions across weeks for each of the guides for each type of help/guidance request over weeks of the year. As a team, we can see the number of requests we’ve addressed over the weeks. Finally, we can check if the overall number of help requests we’ve attended as the weeks have gone by. These graphs are partially based on lcolladotor/mphtasessions. R session information Details on the R version used for making this book. The source code is available at lcolladotor/DSgs_logs. ## Packages used in the book library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) library(&quot;lubridate&quot;) library(&quot;dplyr&quot;) library(&quot;here&quot;) ## Load the package at the top of your script library(&quot;sessioninfo&quot;) ## Reproducibility information print(&#39;Reproducibility information:&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Reproducibility information:&quot; Sys.time() ## [1] &quot;2021-03-12 22:57:12 UTC&quot; proc.time() ## user system elapsed ## 2.650 0.213 2.834 options(width = 120) session_info() ## ─ Session info ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## setting value ## version R Under development (unstable) (2021-03-04 r80066) ## os Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS ## system x86_64, linux-gnu ## ui X11 ## language (EN) ## collate en_US.UTF-8 ## ctype en_US.UTF-8 ## tz Etc/UTC ## date 2021-03-12 ## ## ─ Packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## package * version date lib source ## assertthat 0.2.1 2019-03-21 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## BiocManager * 1.30.10 2019-11-16 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## bookdown 0.21 2020-10-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## cli 2.3.1 2021-02-23 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## colorspace 2.0-0 2020-11-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## crayon 1.4.1 2021-02-08 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## digest 0.6.27 2020-10-24 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## dplyr * 1.0.5 2021-03-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## ellipsis 0.3.1 2020-05-15 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## evaluate 0.14 2019-05-28 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## fansi 0.4.2 2021-01-15 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## farver 2.1.0 2021-02-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## generics 0.1.0 2020-10-31 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## ggplot2 * 3.3.3 2020-12-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## glue 1.4.2 2020-08-27 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## gtable 0.3.0 2019-03-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## here * 1.0.1 2020-12-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## highr 0.8 2019-03-20 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## htmltools 0.5.1.1 2021-01-22 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## knitr 1.31 2021-01-27 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## labeling 0.4.2 2020-10-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## lifecycle 1.0.0 2021-02-15 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## lubridate * 1.7.10 2021-02-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## magrittr 2.0.1 2020-11-17 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## munsell 0.5.0 2018-06-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## pillar 1.5.0 2021-02-22 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## pkgconfig 2.0.3 2019-09-22 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## purrr 0.3.4 2020-04-17 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## R6 2.5.0 2020-10-28 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## RColorBrewer 1.1-2 2014-12-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## Rcpp 1.0.6 2021-01-15 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## rlang 0.4.10 2020-12-30 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## rmarkdown 2.7 2021-02-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## rprojroot 2.0.2 2020-11-15 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## rstudioapi 0.13 2020-11-12 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## scales 1.1.1 2020-05-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## sessioninfo * 1.1.1 2018-11-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## stringi 1.5.3 2020-09-09 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## stringr 1.4.0 2019-02-10 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## tibble 3.1.0 2021-02-25 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## tidyselect 1.1.0 2020-05-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## utf8 1.1.4 2018-05-24 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## vctrs 0.3.6 2020-12-17 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## withr 2.4.1 2021-01-26 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## xfun 0.21 2021-02-10 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## yaml 2.2.1 2020-02-01 [2] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## ## [1] /usr/local/lib/R/host-site-library ## [2] /usr/local/lib/R/site-library ## [3] /usr/local/lib/R/library This book was last updated on 2021-03-12 22:57:12.

Unable to open new terminals and folder permission issues I hadn’t encountered the issue with new local terminals failing to open. I planned to follow up with better specific advice via email, and offer to explain this advice in a future DSGS. 2021-02-25 I need help in: downloading data from SRA to JHPCE, running SPEAQeasy to create rse object (one session will likely not be enough). I explained how to use SPEAQeasy at JHPCE, and we tried an experimental method for downloading SRA data. The method didn’t work, and we plan to meet again after I verify a more typical method works. 2021-03-02 Clarification about how recent CMC data was processed with SPEAQeasy I explained that SPEAQeasy was used for the recent hg38 processing, and an older version of a similar pipeline was used for the original hg19 processing. We discussed our new method for retrieving gene symbols (\"org.*.eg.db\" packages) and some general code advice. 2021-03-03 Advice for writing papers We discussed how Sciwheel can be adapted for different journals, and provided general advice for getting started and formatting a paper for a particular journal.
