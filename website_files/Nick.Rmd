| 2021-02-23 | I need help with setting up Mobaexterm. Unable to open new terminals and folder permission issues | I hadn't encountered the issue with new local terminals failing to open. I planned to follow up with better specific advice via email, and offer to explain this advice in a future DSGS. |
| 2021-02-25 | I need help in: downloading data from SRA to JHPCE, running SPEAQeasy to create rse object (one session will likely not be enough). | I explained how to use SPEAQeasy at JHPCE, and we tried an experimental method for downloading SRA data. The method didn't work, and we plan to meet again after I verify a more typical method works. |
| 2021-03-02 | Clarification about how recent CMC data was processed with SPEAQeasy | I explained that SPEAQeasy was used for the recent hg38 processing, and an older version of a similar pipeline was used for the original hg19 processing.

| 2021-03-22 | Using an LIBD module | I described the need for the "module use" command and modifying the .bashrc to easily use LIBD modules |
