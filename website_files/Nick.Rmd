| 2020-12-09 | Help with importing HDF5 file | Used 'h5ls' command from shell to verify contents of file; eventually found we were looking at the wrong file (error message was cryptic about issue). https://jhu-genomics.slack.com/archives/CUYHWV7AA/p1607034309074800 |
| 2021-01-06 | Correlation values from labeledHeatmap | [BioC Support website answer](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/p133591/#p133927) |
| 2021-02-23 | I need help with setting up Mobaexterm. Unable to open new terminals and folder permission issues | I hadn't encountered the issue with new local terminals failing to open. I planned to follow up with better specific advice via email, and offer to explain this advice in a future DSGS. |
| 2021-02-25 | I need help in: downloading data from SRA to JHPCE, running SPEAQeasy to create rse object (one session will likely not be enough). | I explained how to use SPEAQeasy at JHPCE, and we tried an experimental method for downloading SRA data. The method didn't work, and we plan to meet again after I verify a more typical method works. |
| 2021-03-02 | Clarification about how recent CMC data was processed with SPEAQeasy | I explained that SPEAQeasy was used for the recent hg38 processing, and an older version of a similar pipeline was used for the original hg19 processing. We discussed our new method for retrieving gene symbols ("org.*.eg.db" packages) and some general code advice. |
| 2021-03-02 | Our group's set-up and approach for writing papers with google docs, and managing citations | I went through the setup and example usage of Sciwheel and cross reference, and gave general advice (it's often easiest to start with the "Methods" section, etc) |
| 2021-03-03 | Advice for writing papers | We discussed how Sciwheel can be adapted for different journals, and provided general advice for getting started and formatting a paper for a particular journal. |
| 2021-03-10 | qSVA explanation and code review | Josh walked me through some code performing qSVA for a recent project, and I offered some tips involving code organization/ readibility. |
| 2021-03-18 | Download SRA data and run SPEAQeasy | I fetched the SRA files, created a manifest and execution script for SPEAQeasy, but had an issue running "fastq-dump". I decided to hand off the request, partially complete. |
| 2021-03-22 | Using an LIBD module | I described the need for the "module use" command and modifying the .bashrc to easily use LIBD modules |
| 2021-04-07 | Nextflow overview for work with imputation pipeline | I covered various nextflow concepts, as well as my typical approach in creating and running a nextflow project at JHPCE |
| 2021-04-12 | Running the old RNA-seq pipeline on some SRA data | I showed my typical process for creating a "samples.manifest" file for a given dataset, and how to submit a pipeline run. We continued to debug some minor issues over slack |
| 2021-04-19 | Running SPEAQeasy | Although we encountered permissions issues, I showed how to create a "samples.manifest" file and configure SPEAQeasy for a particular set of samples. |
| 2021-04-22 | Running SPEAQeasy | We went through cloning SPEAQeasy, creating a "samples.manifest" file with R, and other relevant details for running SPEAQeasy at JHPCE. I also helped Henry set up git at JHPCE |
| 2021-04-22 | Running SPEAQeasy- follow up | We troubleshooted strange errors from the main SPEAQeasy output, and saw that I was able to run the main script ("run_pipeline_jhpce.sh") but Sreya encountered errors with an identical script. We suspected permissions issues in her working directory, which she emailed bitsupport about. |
| 2021-04-26 | Running SPEAQeasy- follow up | We discussed how to handle strandness issues, and how different inferred strand patterns within a group of samples sequenced together can indicate problems with the input data. I described how to use the '--force_strand' option with SPEAQeasy |
| 2021-04-28 | Constructing an array job from an existing sequential shell script | I showed how I typically produce an array job shell script for the situation where I have many samples of data to process the same way (SIMD). We talked about using a text file where each line contains one sample name, and referencing that in the array script. |
| 2021-05-03 | Running SPEAQeasy- follow up | We observed an issue where log parsing in SPEAQeasy behaved differently for Sreya and I due to a difference in default python version loaded at JHPCE. I fixed the hisat2/2.2.1 module to ensure consistent python version use. |
| 2021-05-13 | Setting up a SPEAQeasy run | I described how I typically construct a "samples.manifest" file and configure SPEAQeasy for a particular experiment. |
| 2021-05-19 | Making a module | We went through the creation of an LIBD JHPCE module, covering the documentation process, lua syntax, and how to test a module before pushing. |
| 2021-05-19 | Configuring a parallel series of bash scripts | We adapted a series of bash scripts requiring parallel functionality for use at JHPCE. This involved correctly setting some path variables and requesting multiple cores through SGE for some scripts. |
| 2021-06-16 | addressing SPEAQeasy error | we talked about how to use the "--strand" option, the source of the error that was encountered |
