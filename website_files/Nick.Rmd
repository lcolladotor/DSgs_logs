I need help in: downloading data from SRA to JHPCE, running SPEAQeasy to create rse object (one session will likely not be enough).

**Notes**

I explained how to use SPEAQeasy at JHPCE, and we tried an experimental method for downloading SRA data. The method didn't work, and we plan to meet again after I verify a more typical method works.

Clarification about how recent CMC data was processed with SPEAQeasy

**Notes**

I explained that SPEAQeasy was used for the recent hg38 processing, and an older version of a similar pipeline was used for the original hg19 processing. We discussed our new method for retrieving gene symbols ("org.*.eg.db" packages) and some general code advice.
