| ---- | ------------ | ----- |
| 2024-03-14 | I tried to apply "qSV_model_DE_analysis.R" in lithium-exposed samples ( from Dpseq data), but I was confused by some of the code, especially "run_DE.R." | I walked throught the run_DE function I wrote for MDDseq (a wrapper for the limma-voom) pipline. I pointed out what parts of the MDDseq code he could adapt and simplify for his use case (its less complicated than the many DE runs we completed for MDDseq) |
| 2024-03-11 | quick big fix. Its the same eQTL code -- just one header in a file that's always missing | Fernando was having some conectivity issues with JHPCE, so we didn't get a full bug fix in I suggested some de-buggin strategies  [Update 3/15] We met again breifly to confirm the functions were working as intended. Initial issue was caused by un-intentinally overwriting the function |
| 2024-01-25 | making a corrplot with a lot of data points . | Sreya wants to compare the correlation of 5 transcipts with 2k degradation transcripts. She had the data in the right format but needed help appllying the cor function to the table using group_by. Corrrplot was not the correct function for what she wanted to achive here. |
| 2024-01-22 | Maybe divinding them by sample name may help. | Michael and Peter are working on a BPD vs. MDD DE analysis. They were getting more DEGs than were reported in an early version of the MDDseq project. I could not find the code for the data they were refrencing, with out the code it will be impossible to diagnosis what is differnt in the two analysis. I recomended they use the more up to date data from MDDseq, and pointed them to the correct data & scripts. |
| 2024-01-22 | when I try to rerun R dreamlet pseudobulk on the new JHPCE, I keep getting errors... (provided code example) | Tricia and Fernando are re-running serval analysis they previously had working on the sge cluster, with the update to slurm they are now having issues. They are also having differnt errors in the same scrips + data. This could be a multi-facet issue, but firstly sounds like a R package version issue. I advisded the first step should be to have the same set-up, work in the same version of R and the same version (most updated) packages. See what errors persist and go from there. I also recomended Frenando start using git repos and version control with his team to help keep projects organized and consistent. |
| 2023-11-30 | Regarding the transcriptome assay from the multiome approach, I have selected canonical gene markers from the different samples; Moving further, I would like to integrate to the analysis external gene-markers shared by S.Page. I am looking the best way to do this. | Cynthia and Hedia are starting the annotation/cluster integration of the multiome data. The data is currently clusted indiviudally by sample, sn, ATAC only, and combined sn+ATAC. findMarker has be used to calc marker stats for each cluster in each sample (there is a ton of data to digest). I am unfamilar with the sample independendt cluster, consered marker gene integration from seurat. But I gave advice to check the current clusters for hihg expression of any of the known marker genes to see if we're picking up the expected biological signal, and do some prelimary annotations as a sanity check. Also to keep following the workflow and see if the conserved marker genes match with any of the know markers. Also to start recoring annotations for the clusters in a csv file for easy editing by hand as well as easy reading in to R |
| 2023-11-29 | Help with qSVA overview schematic | I advised Hedia on how to adress some issues with the qSVA overview plot, both minor issues like aliginig and resising objects with biorender tools, and major rearngment of the table and DE application part. |
| 2023-11-15 | I would like to discuss with you the correlation issue related to the cellular_component model of the qsvaR package and get your feedback. | Hedia has gotten some feedback on some unexpected behavior from qSVAR package. The qSV values show no significant correlation with other phenotype metrics (they have in the past), while this is not impossible it is strange. There are many factors that could have lead to this issue. Hedia and I talked about some debugging strategies, starting with re-running the workflow on familar data to see if we can re-create the issue or detirmine if it is unique to KJ's dataset. |
| 2023-10-19 | Help migrating to SLURM setup | I walked Lionel through the new login commands for SLURM + updating his bashrc file so he can work with the slurm cluser |
| 2023-10-12 | Prepare expression bed files for tensorQTL | Adapted mode code for tensorQTL prep, had to add genomics ranges to the sce object, and deal with bugs around rse_to_bed function |
| 2023-10-05 | Prepare covariate input files for tensorQTL | Worked through addapting code for tensorQTL prep for the MDD single cell data - had to deal with bugs relating to cell type names |
| 2023-09-29 | Interpretation of results plotted in inflection plots of Cellranger-arc data sets (GEX assays). For example, how do you know which genes are representing neurons or glia? | We looked at the rank vs. total UMI curves relevant for emptyDrops for the atac-seq samples. Cynthia and I have discussed these samples before. We went over how the emptyDrops function works again and what we can guesss is happenin in the curve (neurons vs. glia vs. empty droplets).  She is concerned beause for the 42-4 sample the wetbench target number of nuc was 7k, emptyDrops retrurns 9k. I thought that that sounded in the right ball park |
| 2023-09-22 | help get normalized single cell data from a single cell rse for downstream eQTL | I helped Fernando modify my code for creating input files to work witht the new pseudobulk data. Wegot the gene PCs done, he needs to get the genotype files together for this data before we can move to the next steps. Planning to meet more next week to continue this process. |
| 2023-09-21 | Discuss deconvolution for some future work | Peter and Reza were interested in running deconvolution on the bulk MDDseq with the new large MDD snRNA-seq dataset. The MDD snRNA-seq dataset is only sACC, we concluded that only haveing one region might make this analysis a bit awkward for the Amyg data. I them to the current deconvolution results and how we applied thoes results in downstream analysis. |
| 2023-09-21 | help get normalized single cell data from a single cell rse for downstream eQTL | I walked Fernando through using registration_pseudobulk() on the large MDD single cell dataset and went over how the function works. We are planning to meet agian to go over running PCA to prep for eQTL analysis. |
| 2023-09-06 | snRNAseq celltype grouping in DLPFC data | I discussed diagnosing marker quality with Maddy + Stephanie Page for the spatial hypocampus project. They are on the right track, and have created violin + hockystick plots for the different iterations of the dataset. I advised they elimate a noisy cluster and re-compute markers. |
| 2023-08-21 | I performed the whole analysis as previously established and also made an alternative version based on knowledge of OSCA book for single nuclei (with adaptive thresholds for QC and less tolerance for mito UMIs). Would you help me checking my QC thresholds and seeing if they make sense? | Alan has used MAD cutoffs on total UMIs, genes detected, mito %, and a metric we haven't worked with yet: genes per UMI. He evaluated the data all together (not by sample) and chose #Mads by what seemed reasonable. The values he has used look good, but perhaps a bit strict. We looked at the distributions, which are slightly different between samples, I advised he use scater::isOutlier to see what the cutoffs would be by sample. One step he is lacking is doublet detection, I suggested he apply scDblFinder::computeDoubletDensity. Alan already has clusteres and annoted this data (lots of work) I suggested that a great double check is to calcluate the median value of the QC metrics for each final cluster and see if any are much higher than the others as a good double check that his initial QC process worked well. |
| 2023-08-10 | writing tweets efficiently | I gave some pointers about writing tweets. Mostly keep it simple, give people a call to action "check out this link!", add something eye catching. Also to spend sometime reading tweets and pay attention to what you like that other people tweet? What caught your interest? We also talked some stradgedy about tweeting around confrences, calling peoples attention to your talk/making it easy for people to find you to get in touch |
| 2023-08-09 | Running DeconvoBuddies on the Mathy's data | We talked thorough the thigns to think about for the Mathy's dataset (this dataset has case + control paitents and found DEGs w/in cell types). I advised to start simple with the broad cell tytpes and not consider Dx at first. Check if the DEG they idetified are in our marker set. I think this will need some discussion with the project team if Dx is a concern for spot deconvolution. |
| 2023-07-26 | Feeback on spatial data + code organization | We ttok a look at the changes in the clustring in the spatial data before and after cropping out a area of questionalble quality. To me it looks like the QC params are too strict leaving spots floating in space, which I'm guessing is contributing to weird BayesSpace results (but this is a guess). We also talked code organization strtagedy - mostly keep it simple and consistent |
| 2023-07-26 | Feedback on workshop vignette | I helped Hedia improve the formatting & content for her BioC qSVA workshop, main feedback ins to focus on and highlight the qsvaR steps in the workflow (rather than SummarizedExperiment overvew & DEG analysis) |
| 2023-07-25 | Practice BioC talk | I helped Daianna practice her BioC short talk, Mostly she needs to give more slides to discussing her results & include more actual plots not just icons (she much improved this presentation for the 7/26 meeting :) ) |
| 2023-06-28 | About empty drops run with GEX cellranger-arc data | Cynthia has run DropletUtils::emptyDrops on the two LIBD + two example samples. We first clarified some terms and outputs she had recorded. For the most part DropletUtils returns similar number of non-empty cells as CellRanger arc, but Cynthia didn't confirm that the two methods flag the same cells. I asked her to creat a confision matrix between the two methods for each sample to check this.  The main concern Cynthia has was the LIBD sample with only  3k cells input, has 9k non-empty droplets returned by emptyDrops. This is quite odd as the CellRanger Arc metrics look quite bad for this sample, but the DropletUtils metrics look fine (there are high UMI values for many droplets). We will want to dig in to this more to understand the differnces between the two methods. |
| 2023-06-15 | 1/Learn about the roxygen2 syntax for examples. 2/Run devtools::document() like in dev/04_update.R (maybe also auto-style code). 3/Edit the news.md file + bump version on the DESCRIPTION (and change the date). 4/Learn about how to sync her local repo with steps like http://contributions.bioconductor.org/git-version-control.html#new-package-workflow (aka register to https://git.bioconductor.org/BiocCredentials/login/?next=/BiocCredentials/ like @Daianna González + add the upstream remote + git push to both upstream and origin). | We started with getting github token access for Hedia's laptop working. Then started a pull request using usethis for qSVA, for Hedia to add seed capabilities to several functions. We will need to meet several more times to complete the whole help request |
| 2023-06-14 | I created this github repo: https://github.com/LieberInstitute/neurovasculature-pilot/tree/main. Also, integrated it with slack, but instead of integrating the main branch, I linked the devel branch, and I am unable to see the commits that I make on slack. They are updated on github, though. So, I need help with the integration. | Uma mentioned that she had to login everytime she pushed a commit from the directory in question (but not other repos). I thought we should start by using a github access token to update her login to github from JHPCE. The best way I know how to do this is to use gitcreds::gitcreds_set() in R. At first it gave us an error, which was solved by adding the git modules loaded in the team bashrc to Uma's basrc file as well as her .gitconfig file. After that we were able to save the token to her JHPCe setup and the github push issue seemed to be solved |
| 2023-06-08 | Options for cell type specific eQTLs | Reviewed input for tensorqtl (it is counts, not logcounts), and revised what how we filter lowly expressed exon-exon junctions using http://research.libd.org/jaffelab/reference/expression_cutoff.html. |
| 2023-05-09 | Overfitting in qSVA | Hedia was concerned about the large number of variables in the reproducibility DE experiment, specifically the PC. I pointed out that the point of the anlaysis was to test the effectiveness of the models (with and without qSVs) so while this might be a valid concern in a sperate DE analysis, we are testing model quality here. I also noticed that the reproducibility anlaysis was not using functions from the qsvaR package, and that as qsvaR is the "product" of this whole project its important we use the functions in this anlysis . |
| 2023-03-24 | tensorQTL code overview | Trish and I went over the code I previoulsy wrote for tensorQTL, and some of the custom functions for preparing the input data. How to input the different datatypes in to python, and run the function, and strategies  for running the different cell types in parralell on the GPU queue |
| 2023-03-23 | Check some issues with GitHub Actions | I helped Daianna decipher an error message she got in the BioC check in the GitHub Actions involving a local path harcoded in to one of her tests. We also debugged for similar issues by searching her code for other local paths that would cause her code  to break when run remotely |
| 2023-03-20 | tensorQTL pipeline overview | I shared the tensorQTL example I presented at rstats club. We also went over the different in-puts and formats, including some we can re-use from bulk MDDseq. WE also discusses the differnt setting for tensorQTL and how to adapt sh files to submit to the GPU queue |
| 2023-03-01 | Deconvolu code where the bisque doesnt show any differences | Sreya was having some issues with functions from DeconvoBuddies, namley plot_marker_express. I am going to check that on my end as it seems like her computer wasn't finding the support functions for the main function. She was also having trouble matching the gene names between the sce and bulk rse objects, the ensembl names seemd to have differnt versions, I advided she maybe switch to using the gene symbols to keep things simple. |
| 2023-02-21 | Creating marker heatmaps with pseudobulk data | We went over the ratioinal behind psuedobulking and how we can use heatmaps to show marker experssion. Created psuedobulk data for three different clustering methods, and went over the basic process of making heatmaps. Bukola will work on the aestetics of the heatmaps, and cerate one for all thee clustering methods. |
| 2023-02-17 | Setting up .bashrc file for folder access permission for DLPFC-SCZ project | related to my meeting with Uma on 2/10. We fixed Boyi's bashrc to allow group write by deafult, fixing the ,git issue and eliminating the need to re-run the permission update script often |
| 2023-02-10 | I have questions on GitHub and submitting SGE jobs. | Uma was having file permission issues, the group permissions for several files in a shared project were set to read only. This was causing issues with the team using scripts but also in making git commits as some of the idex files in .git were read-only. We updated her bashrc files to contain "umask u=rwx,g=rwx,o= ## equivalent to umask 007" to prevent this in the future and ran the premissoin update script. |
| 2023-02-09 | Moving forward with multiple cluster methods | Bukola hads run muliple clustering methods on the habenula data, I advised she pick the two that were the most simmlar to ERiks previous annotations (we were happy with) via rand index, and start examining marker gene expression. |
| 2023-01-19 | GitHub for a beginner | Hope created a github account and I talked her thuogth the basics of git, But we hit a snag with the instalation of git on her laptop, git is built in to xcode in the ventura OS (which her machine is running) but she had some trouble with that instalation too. Shes going to try and fix that independtly, and reasch out if she needs more help gettign off hte ground with git + github |
| 2023-01-18 | snRNA-seq GLM PCA | We adapted code from the DLPFC work and https://www.stephaniehicks.com/biocdemo/articles/Demo.html to run GLM-PCA to prep for batch correction |
| 2023-01-13 | snRNA-seq QC | Bukola and I adapted QC code for the habenula data |
| 2023-01-11 | Plotting Gene Expression with SCE | Continuing Sreyas work with the single cell mouse data, I pointed her towards scater::plotExpression to plot some of the genes her group is intested in observing by cell type. However we ran in to some bugs with running logNormCounts which we think is from an old version of R. I advised that she update R and re-install the packages, hopefull that will fix the issue. |
| 2023-01-04 | Help building SCE with downloaded data | I helped Sreya build a single cell experiment object with expression and metadata csvs she had from an publication. Hopefully she can use this to independently explore the gene expression her group is interested in. |
| 2022-12-14 | Discuss Mean Ratio marker gene finding | Hedia wanted some background information about the deconvolution process we applied to the degradation data. I explained the mean ratio marker finding, the resulting stats, and how we ued them to build our set of marker genes. Then the script for how we ran bisque + the output of bisque . |
| 2022-12-14 | Deconvolution study with rnaseq bulk data | Sreya wants to test if a gene of intrest to her group is associaited with a ceratain cell type. They are working with bulk mouse data. I suggested that deconvolution may not be able to answer theire innital question but can provide depth to their bulk analysis. I suggested that they find a mouse single cell dataset that is relevant to their current data set, then first observe their gene of interest their, see if that answers any questions. Then they could use that data to run deconvioltion with bisuqe (I suggested a follow up meeting if she needs guidance with this) |
| 2022-11-30 | Understanding PCA for Habenula project | We discussed how PCA reduces the dimesions of our data and helps show the variance between samples. I helped Bukola strategize how to make PCA plots for the habenula data. Start plotting the first 5 PCs pairwise, color by Dx. Then explore key QC or demographic variables, see if we can indentify any patterns. I was unsure if she should repeat this for exon, jx, tx, as we didnt for MDDseq. But figured gene was a good place to start and if the other features should be explored too, the code should be easily adapatabe. |
| 2022-11-30 | Review deconvolition script for qSVA | I gave Hedia a breif overview of the goals and process of deconvolution, including mean ratio marker finding. I linked my deconvolution slides. We then went over the code for running bisque on the qSVA dataset, including details of the input, refrence, and output data. |
| 2022-11-03 | help submitting jobs with R parallelization in jhpce. For instance, I would like to use scater::runPCA with the BPPARAM=BiocParallel::MulticoreParam(8)) parameter | Tricia is trying to run glmPCA on the very large MDD snRNA-seq dataset. She has a run submitted without parallelization that has been runing for 3 days. To try and speed things up she has been trying to use BioCparrallel, via MulticoreParam. But the scheduler keeps killing her job. We checked that -pe local X and MulticoreParam(X) match , so it wasn't that. I recomended she try to run a subset of the data to get a sense of how glmPCA uses memory. But couldn't come up with a fix to make the parallelization work. As its PCA it also can't be run as subsets, so there aren't other workarounds :( I think BioCparallel + sge scheduling would be a good topic for Rstats club as this seems to be a common headache |
| 2022-10-27 | I have this single nucleus RNA sequencing experiment with the mouse LS that Matt analyzed and we have a final single cell experiment, but I don't know how to do anything with this data set and want to learn how to plot heatmaps and possibly other things for this data set. Can we maybe schedule an hour to start this learning process and then I can schedule future time as needed? | Lionel walked me through some plots they need for the LS paper: marker genes heatmap and expression violin plots. I pointed him to some code from DLPFC sn that should be helpful (he needs access to this repo). He also needs to get setup with JHPCE on his new laptop, I pointed him to the team laptop setup docs. He also is new to ggplot, so I pointed him to the visulization chapeter of R for data scientist. This will probaly require some follow up meetings |
| 2022-10-26 | Check the DEG heatmaps | Daianna has added a new color scheme to the heatmaps that makes the differnces between positive and negative more clear, how ever I think the darkest red being close to 0 is misleading, so shes going to fix that. I also recomended she simplify the annotaions on the combined heatmap so its easier to find and interpret patterns. |
| 2022-10-17 | Review TMM paper | We reviewed the reasons or correcting counts and why thats important for DE analysis. We went over the math behind TMM, and then how thoes ideas are used in edgeR. I pointed Bukola to a stats quest video with a more detatiled explination of how the edgeR correction works. |
| 2022-10-14 | csvs that I want to merge together | Sang Ho showed me the csv files that he exported from different moduled on HALO. They seem to have the same rows, so copying the needed column in to a differnt csv is easy in excel (where Sang Ho is working) but I showed him how to check that things are really aligned with some excel functions. We also looked at the data in prism, which I had to quickly learned about. I advised that he should show the data in boxplots not as a barplot to better display that data, and went over the checks for running an anova. |
| 2022-10-11 | GO and KEGG boxplots with the modifications you suggested | Daianna showed me her dot plots with the correct 0.05 q val filter, they looked good, ready for discussion. One tweak , is hshe had a combined up + down expresion col for some plots which was redundant and should be removed. She had also made some heatmaps that didn;t show very much difference between case control, htey probaly need to be normalized by the genes overall expression, but I need to check prevous work to remeber how to best do that |
| 2022-10-10 | QC approach for hebenula | We went throught boxplots Bukola had made for the data, I suggested she add geom_jitter and how to make that work with geom_repel to help show more details about the data. We also discussed direct vs. standard evaluation of variable and how that makes writing funcitons with tidyverse tricky, but how she can use aes_() to do stadard eval with ggplot |
| 2022-10-05 | How to check technical effects for RNAseq data | I walked Bukola through our process for buld data QC, which involves making many exploratory plots of QC metrics and know groups (like batch, or case/control) to understand patterns and identify problematics samples. Then later implementing cutoff values either based on stats (like a 3 MAD cut off) or knowlege of ressonable values. Bukola will spend some time plotting QC values, adapting code from smoking mouse, then we will meet again to interpret these plots. |
| 2022-10-05 | Reviewing GO results and dotplots | Daianna and I went over the dot plots she made for GO analysis from the multiple DE test she ran. Her plots look good, but we identified that she needed to use the default q cutoff to get useful results. She will rerun the GO analysis and replot the results. |
| 2022-09-30 | Working on making a violin plot for just one gene. So by brain region rather than gene type | We adapted my_plotExpression() (a function I wrote) to work for Bukola's data. This required some debugging as subsetting to just the one gene in question altered how some internal dataframes looked. I also gave Bukola some pointers about saving plots using ggplot. |
| 2022-09-30 | Question on the feasibility of some approach with HALO (for the AD project) | Sang Ho walked me through an analysis they want to do for the AD project, it involves annotating HALO data. We talked thought a strategy, this may be a bit computationally tricky to implement but it seems doable. |
| 2022-08-22 | DE analysis introduction | I went over the DE pipeline we use, noting that the model development is the most demanding and non-static part. We talked specifics for their dataset which has some experimental design to consider as its organids and is diffrent from patient case control. I posinted Geo to scripts where we do QC, expression cutoff, and my run_DE script |
| 2022-08-18 | Git push help | Heena saw old commits pop up on slacks git notifications when she pushed commits she had locally on her laptop, but they didn't reappear in the git history. I think she did everything right and there might be something strange with the behavior of the slack message (as thats the only place things seemd wrong). We did some detective work between the files and the commits, everything seems good. Heena was able to then pull to the cluster with out conflicts |
| 2022-08-17 | check the models and the results I have obtained so far from the DEA | Had to work over slack again as Daianna was having trouble with zoom. Working with the feedback from the previous meetings, the experimetn has been narrowed down to 5 DE runs, and then comparing some pairs of the outputs. We were unsure if we should include mitoRate as a variable in the adult model as it correlates highly with totalAssignedGene, but decided to include it for now to match the model used in the pup DEA. I also sent her some code I have used to make scatter plots of t-stats to help compare DE results. |
| 2022-08-10 | Check the model design of the smoking mouse project | We intended to meet on zoom, but Daianna's connection was bad so we used Slack to chat. Daianna has made many plots and visuals about the many DE analysis for smoking mouse. I gave her some feedback about orgaizing her slides so the figures can practically be used inform DE models, right now everything is a bit scattered as shes planning on running 7 analysis so there is a lot to consider. We will need to meet again to finish this. |
| 2022-08-03 | Review results of Varaince Parition for smoking mouse | Daianna showed me her varianceParition plots, and we talked bout how to design the DE anlaysis based on what she's oberved in the mouse data. I advised to keep things simpler (ie not create too many groups) but rather use models to control for vaiables adding variance. We will meet next to talk model design for this work. |
| 2022-07-15 | QC update for smoking mouse | Daianna shared her updated QC plots, adn the one sample she planned to drop based on fastCellQC. I advised that she dig deeper in to how that QC finstion works, and what the cutoff values are, as well as exmaming mito vs. ribo precentages, and a two samples that don't seem to group with others of the same phenotype / |
| 2022-07-07 | help row annotation colors of a pheatmap | I explained how to get pheatmap to use the same color scheme for column and row annotations by making the annotaion tables have the same colname, and suppying a color pallet |
| 2022-07-07 | Subsetting eQTL results with in risk loci | We discussed a strategy to subset the 102 loci in question, and adapted code to subset the FDR signif pairs to work with the location info. |
| 2022-07-05 | QC update for smoking mouse | Daianna shared the updates she made to the QC plots based on our previous discussion, specifically separating brain and blood samples. |
| 2022-06-28 | Review progress on smoking mouse DE project | Daianna walked me through her progress in the DE analysis. We went over QC plots and discussed experimental design. She will check in with Kristen about how to organize the brain vs. blood samples. Currently she dropped the blood sampeles as they looked very different in several QC metrics. But I advised that they just be handled seperatly as it makes senese they look different as they are different tissue, and the signal is probaly biological rather than technical |
| 2022-06-17 | JHPCE Github setup | We fixed Sanjana's ssh set up and got the qrsh command working. We got git configurated for her locally and on JHPCE, as well as set up tokens. Created a test repo, and made commits from her laptop and JHPCE as an example |
| 2022-06-15 | Github setup | We went over github basics and motivation behind version control. Quickly discovered that Sanjana's qrsh command is not working, requiring a password. Ended up using the session to troubleshoot that, with no success :( planning on circling back/re-setting up ssh for her. Will meet later about git setup |
| 2022-06-15 | Revisited the sc analysis and could use some help | We checked Sreya's code against the OSCA DE example run. She was worried that there weren't may significant genes, but her results seemed to be in the same range (10s of genes) as the example. We discussed how maybe there were QC or demographic variables that could have been added to the model, but the data she has doesn't have much to work with. We will revisit when I have maybe done more work with sn DE analysis. |
| 2022-06-03 | I might need a review of how to go about selecting marker genes for the spatialDLPFC data. Also, I'm curious what code you have for making heatmaps showing marker gene expression across cell types. | I pointed Nick to a few scripts used in marker finding for the Tran Maynard dataset, using a few functions from DeconvoBuddies. For marker heat maps we went over how I hace built annotation tables, and a few tricks for optimizing pheatmaps for maker plots. |
| 2022-06-02 | Single cell rna seq analysis | We converted a downloaded dataset from tsv files to a sce object. Went over a strategy for performing DE on single cell data, using OSCA as a reference |
| 2022-06-01 | I have a mouse single-cell RNAseq data that I am aiming to identify cell types in different clusters. | We spent the session getting Sanjana set up better to work on JHPCE, setting up ssh keys, cyberduck, RStudio, and config files. Plan to meet again to set up git + start single cell work |

| 2021-10-25 | We would love an opinion on our (now cell-type assigned) single nuclei rna-seq data, i.e. how they look - if anything is off, advice for improvement... | Two main issues were discussed: **1**. After batch correction there is one sample that clusters mostly independently from the other samples. This sample did not stand out in QC (althogh this will be re-examined). There is some evidence that this donor might have been clinacally different from the other donors, and since the batch correction worked well for the other samples, there is the possibility that this is real biologal signal. However since there is only one such sample it would be really hard to confirm this, and the inclusion of this sample would counfound the biologcal question of interest. I advisied to drop this sample post-clustering on the grounds that this donor might be too differnt from the others. **2**. Prelimnary results from DEG by cell type for the three groups find mitocondral genes are the most differntly expressed. They are concerned as MT RNA could be a technical artifact (contamination) this tech isn't the best to explore this. But there is are other findings that cellular metabolism may play a role in this condition. I advisied to keep the DEG results with the MT, add the caveat in the paper that this might not be a perfect experiment for this but it could support real differnces in the cells (plus they already have pretty strict MT QC). Also run a second DEA w/o MT genes to see what other signal exists. |
| 2021-10-23 | I am trying to compute DEGs from thefunction registration_stats_enrichment... 
Error in limma::makeContrasts(contrasts = z, levels = registration_model) :
The levels must by syntactically valid names in R | The error came from the names of the clusters just being integers, the names for limma need to be sytactically valid (not just numbers, no spaces, no special characters - basically need to be variable names in R). I advised to simply add a prefix like we did in spatialDLPFC (sp9k1) or even simpler like "c" to her cluster names. Maybe we should add a warning to the function about cluster names since this error is pretty hard for users to de-bug and people often have non-sytactucally valid cluster names (especally with cell type names) |
