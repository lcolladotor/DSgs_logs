**Help request**

Plotly help if possible? I'm trying to export an html file that allows the user to look at each snp/gene on the plot, and I am almost successful. Leo recommended that I talk to you on this matter.

**Notes**

Needed to use highlight_key and highlight functions to select points between plots. Used rstats example as guide https://gist.github.com/lcolladotor/350ac8843e153d135f64880a1d029b14
